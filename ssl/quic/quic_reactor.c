 * Blocking I/O Adaptation Layer

/*
 * Utility which can be used to poll on up to two FDs. This is designed to
 * support use of split FDs (e.g. with SSL_set_rfd and SSL_set_wfd where
 * different FDs are used for read and write).
 *
 * Generally use of poll(2) is preferred where available. Windows, however,
 * hasn't traditionally offered poll(2), only select(2). WSAPoll() was
 * introduced in Vista but has seemingly been buggy until relatively recent
 * versions of Windows 10. Moreover we support XP so this is not a suitable
 * target anyway. However, the traditional issues with select(2) turn out not to
 * be an issue on Windows; whereas traditional *NIX select(2) uses a bitmap of
 * FDs (and thus is limited in the magnitude of the FDs expressible), Windows
 * select(2) is very different. In Windows, socket handles are not allocated
 * contiguously from zero and thus this bitmap approach was infeasible. Thus in
 * adapting the Berkeley sockets API to Windows a different approach was taken
 * whereby the fd_set contains a fixed length array of socket handles and an
 * integer indicating how many entries are valid; thus Windows select()
 * ironically is actually much more like *NIX poll(2) than *NIX select(2). In
 * any case, this means that the relevant limit for Windows select() is the
 * number of FDs being polled, not the magnitude of those FDs. Since we only
 * poll for two FDs here, this limit does not concern us.
 *
 * Usage: rfd and wfd may be the same or different. Either or both may also be
 * -1. If rfd_want_read is 1, rfd is polled for readability, and if
 * wfd_want_write is 1, wfd is polled for writability. Note that since any
 * passed FD is always polled for error conditions, setting rfd_want_read=0 and
 * wfd_want_write=0 is not the same as passing -1 for both FDs.
 *
 * deadline is a timestamp to return at. If it is ossl_time_infinite(), the call
 * never times out.
 *
 * Returns 0 on error and 1 on success. Timeout expiry is considered a success
 * condition. We don't elaborate our return values here because the way we are
 * actually using this doesn't currently care.
 *
 * If mutex is non-NULL, it is assumed to be held for write and is unlocked for
 * the duration of the call.
 *
 * Precondition:   mutex is NULL or is held for write (unchecked)
 * Postcondition:  mutex is NULL or is held for write (unless
 *                   CRYPTO_THREAD_write_lock fails)
