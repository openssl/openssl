/*
 * QUIC Object Structure.
 *
 * In the libssl APL, we have QLSOs, QCSOs and QSSOs, and in the future might
 * choose to introduce QDSOs. There are also roles such as Port Leader and Event
 * Leader which can be assumed by these different types under different
 * circumstances â€” in other words, whether an APL object is a Port or Event
 * Leader is not a static function of its type and these roles can 'float'
 * dynamically depending on the circumstances under which an APL object was
 * created.
 *
 * The QUIC_OBJ is a base type for QUIC APL objects which provides functionality
 * common to all QUIC objects and which supports having different APL objects
 * dynamically assume leader roles. It can therefore be seen as an extention of
 * the SSL base class and extends the SSL object for QUIC APL objects. This
 * avoids duplication of functionality for different types of QUIC object and
 * allows access to common responsibilities of different types of APL object
 * without regard to the kind of APL object we are dealing with.
 *
 * The "inheritance" hierarchy is as follows:
 *
 *   SSL
 *      SSL_CONNECTION
 *      QUIC_OBJ
 *          QUIC_DOMAIN         (QDSO) -> QUIC_ENGINE  *E
 *          QUIC_LISTENER       (QLSO) -> QUIC_PORT     eP
 *          QUIC_CONNECTION     (QCSO) -> QUIC_CHANNEL  epCs
 *          QUIC_XSO            (QSSO) -> QUIC_STREAM      S
 *
 * Legend:
 *
 *   *: Not currently modelled in the APL, though QUIC_ENGINE exists internally.
 *
 *   E: Always an event leader if it exists.
 *   e: Potentially an event leader (namely if it is the root APL object in a
 *      hierarchy).
 *
 *   P: Always a port leader if it exists.
 *   p: Potentially a port leader (namely if there is no port leader above it).
 *
 *   C: Always a connection leader.
 *
 *   s: Potentially usable as a stream (if it has a default stream attached).
 *   S: Always has the stream role if it exists.
 *
 * This structure must come at the start of a QUIC object structure definition.
 *
 * ssl->type still determines the actual object type. An SSL object pointer s
 * can be safely cast to (QUIC_OBJ *) iff IS_QUIC(s) is true.
