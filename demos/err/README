This directory contains a simple example of how to use the ERR functions of
OpenSSL to add error codes to an external application.

To test it first do "make errors". This will build error codes and add them
to the header files. It will also create some functions to load error codes.
Notice how "test_err.h" is updated after this call and the C source file
"test_err.c" is created. These names are in the test_err.ec file passed to the
mkerr.pl script.

Then do "make" which will build the test application.
