OpenSSL Simple Echo Client/Server
=================================

This project implements a simple echo client/server.

It is a console application, with command line parameters determining the mode
of operation (client or server). Start it with no parameters to see usage.

The server code was adapted from the Simple TLS Server on the OpenSSL Wiki.
The server code was modified to perform the echo function, and client code
was added to open a connection with the server and to send keyboard input
to the server.

The new client code illustrates that:

- Connection to the SSL server starts as a standard TCP 'connect'.
- Once connected with TCP, the client 'upgrades' to SSL using
  SSL_connect().
- When the SSL connection completes, data is sent and received using
  SSL_write() and SSL_read().
- Pretty simple.

Being a newbie to SSL, I found it of interest that the same, default, cert.pem
and key.pem files can be used by both client and server. Apparently all that's
needed are valid public and private keys.
