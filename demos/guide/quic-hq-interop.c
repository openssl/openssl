/**
 * @file quic-hq-interop.c
 * @brief QUIC client interoperability demo using OpenSSL.
 *
 * This file contains the implementation of a QUIC client that demonstrates
 * interoperability with hq-interop servers. It handles connection setup,
 * session caching, key logging, and sending HTTP GET requests over QUIC.
 *
 * The file includes functions for setting up SSL/TLS contexts, managing session
 * caches, and handling I/O failures. It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections
 * and uses non-blocking mode for QUIC operations.
 *
 * The client sends HTTP/1.0 GET requests for specified files and saves the
 * responses to disk. It demonstrates OpenSSL's QUIC API, including ALPN protocol
 * settings, peer address management, and SSL handshake and shutdown processes.
 *
 * @note This client is intended for demonstration purposes and may require
 * additional error handling and robustness improvements for production use.
 *
 * USAGE
 * quic-hq-interop <host> <port> <reqfile>
 * host - The hostname of the server to contact
 * port - The port that the server is listening on
 * reqfile - a text file containing a space separated list of paths to fetch
 *           via http 1.0 GET requests
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
 * SSLKEYLOGFILE - set to a file path to record keylog exchange with server
 * SSL_SESSION_FILE - set to a file path to record ssl sessions and restore
 *                    said sessions on next invocation
 * SSL_CERT_FILE - The ca file to use when validating a server
 * SSL_CIPHER_SUITES - The list of cipher suites to use (see openssl-ciphers)
