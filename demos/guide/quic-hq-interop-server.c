/**
 * @file quic-hq-interop-server.c
 * @brief Minimal QUIC HTTP/0.9 server implementation.
 *
 * This file implements a lightweight QUIC server supporting the HTTP/0.9
 * protocol for interoperability testing. It includes functions for setting
 * up a secure QUIC connection, handling ALPN negotiation, and serving client
 * requests.  Intended for use with the quic-interop-runner 
 * available at https://interop.seemann.io
 *
 * Key functionalities:
 * - Setting up SSL_CTX with QUIC support.
 * - Negotiating ALPN strings during the TLS handshake.
 * - Listening and accepting incoming QUIC connections.
 * - Handling client requests via HTTP/0.9 protocol.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   <port> <server.crt> <server.key>
 * The server binds to the specified port and serves files using the given
 * certificate and private key.
 *
 * Environment variables:
 * - FILEPREFIX: Specifies the directory containing files to serve.
 *   Defaults to "./downloads" if not set.
 * - SSLKEYLOGFILE: specifies that keylogging should be preformed on the server
 *   should be set to a file name to record keylog data to
 * - NO_ADDR_VALIDATE: Disables server address validation of clients
 *

 * ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).
 *
 * @param cert_path Path to the server's certificate chain file in PEM format.

 *
 * Configuration:
 * - Loads the certificate chain and private key into the context.

 * - Sets up the ALPN selection callback for protocol negotiation.

 * Usage:
 * - Call this function to create an SSL_CTX before starting the QUIC server.

/**
 * @brief Entry point for the minimal QUIC HTTP/0.9 server.
 *
 * This function initializes the server, sets up a QUIC context, binds a UDP
 * socket to the specified port, and starts the main QUIC server loop to handle
 * client connections and requests.
 *
 * @param argc Number of command-line arguments.
 * @param argv Array of command-line arguments:
 *             - argv[0]: Program name.
 *             - argv[1]: Port number to bind the server.
 *             - argv[2]: Path to the server's certificate file (PEM format).
 *             - argv[3]: Path to the server's private key file (PEM format).
 *
 * @return Returns EXIT_SUCCESS on successful execution, or EXIT_FAILURE
 *         on error.
 *
 * Operation:
 * - Validates the command-line arguments.
 * - Reads the FILEPREFIX environment variable to set the file prefix for
 *   serving files (default is "./downloads").
 * - Creates an SSL_CTX with QUIC support using the provided certificate and
 *   key files.
 * - Parses and validates the port number.
 * - Creates and binds a UDP socket to the specified port.
 * - Starts the server loop using `run_quic_server` to accept and process
 *   client connections.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If any initialization step fails (e.g., invalid arguments, socket
 *   creation, context setup), appropriate error messages are logged, and
 *   the program exits with EXIT_FAILURE.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Run the program with the required arguments to start the server:
 *   `./server <port> <server.crt> <server.key>`
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Ensure that the certificate and key files exist and are valid.
 * - The server serves files from the directory specified by FILEPREFIX.
