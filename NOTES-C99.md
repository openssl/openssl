Notes on C-99
=============

This file contains a list of C-99 features we don't allow for OpenSSL.
Starting with 3.6 OpenSSL project is going to gradually adopt C-99 features.
The plan is to bring those features in small steps. Either with new
code where particular C-99 construct makes sense (think of designated initializers),
or when refactoring existing code and using C-99 language feature improves
readability/maintainability of the code.  C-99 seems to be implemented by major
compilers ([clang](https://clang.llvm.org/c_status.html#c99), [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html), [msvc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/visual-cpp-language-conformance?view=msvc-170)), therefore we can opt
for permissive policy to adopt C-99 standard. This approach means OpenSSL
project accepts all C-99 features except those explicitly listed here.
The list here is going to be updated by features we either

   - find not useful (or not a good match) for OpenSSL

   - the feature is not implemented by some non-mainstream compiler which
     we need to keep supported for benefit of OpenSSL users

The list of C-99 features we don't support in OpenSSL project follows:

   - do not use `//` for comments, stick to `/* ... */`
