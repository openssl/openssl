### High-profile incidents and investigations

On July 20, 2012, James Eagan Holmes, a 24-year-old former neuroscience graduate student, carried out a mass shooting at the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others.[129] He used firearms including a semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun, and a handgun.[129] Holmes had rigged his apartment with explosives, which were later neutralized by authorities, and he surrendered to police outside the theater after the attack.[129]

The investigation revealed Holmes had planned the attack for months, acquiring weapons legally, and that he suffered from mental health issues including schizophrenia, though he was deemed legally sane. He was convicted on 165 counts of murder, attempted murder, and explosives possession in July 2015 and sentenced to 12 consecutive life terms without parole. *See main article: [2012 Aurora shooting](https://grokipedia.com/page/2012_Aurora_shooting)*
