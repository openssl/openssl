 * The _WIN32_WINNT is described here:
 * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/porting/modifying-winver-and-win32-winnt?view=msvc-170
 * In a nutshell the macro defines minimal required Windows version where
 * the resulting application is guaranteed to run on. If left undefined here,
 * then the definition is provided by the Windows SDK found on host where
 * application is being built.
 *
 * OpenSSL defaults to version 0x501, which matches Windows XP, meaning the
 * compiled library will use APIs available on Windows XP and later.  User may
 * override the version specified here at build time using command as
 * follows:
 *     perl ./Configure "-D_WIN32_WINNT=0x...." ...
 *
 * The list of recognized constants (as found in the link above) is as follows:
 * 	0x0400 // Windows NT 4.0
 *	0x0500 // Windows 2000
 *	0x0501 // Windows XP
 *	0x0502 // Windows Server 2003
 *	0x0600 // Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista
 *	0x0601 // Windows 7
 *	0x0602 // Windows 8
 *	0x0603 // Windows 8.1
 *	0x0A00 // Windows 10

 * at run-time [DSO_global_lookup is recommended]...
