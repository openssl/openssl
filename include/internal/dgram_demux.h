/*
 * Generic Datagram Demuxer
 * ========================
 *
 * The datagram demuxer is responsible for receiving datagrams from the network
 * via a datagram BIO. It maintains a pool of Unprocessed RX Entries (URXEs)
 * for efficient batch receiving via BIO_recvmmsg().
 *
 * The demuxer is protocol-agnostic. It receives datagrams and invokes a
 * callback for each one. The callback is responsible for routing the datagram
 * to the appropriate connection (e.g., by DCID for QUIC, or by peer address
 * for DTLS).

 * which are unused by DTLS. This allows QUIC_URXE to be a simple typedef to
 * DGRAM_URXE, enabling QUIC_DEMUX to wrap DGRAM_DEMUX without list type issues.
