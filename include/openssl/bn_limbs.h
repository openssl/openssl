/**
 * @file Defines the type of large integer limbs.
 *
 * The large number is composed of words, the size of which is assumed to
 * be optimal for the platform it's built for.  In many large number texts,
 * these words are called "limb".  The BIGNUM library also calls this "word".
 *
 * In OpenSSL code, the BIGNUM "limb" is represented with the type macro
 * BN_ULONG.
