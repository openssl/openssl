  RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS

  AVAILABLE PATCHES

    o CA.pl patch (Damien Miller)

  IN PROGRESS

    o Steve is currently working on (in no particular order):
        Proper (or at least usable) certificate chain verification.
	Private key, certificate and CRL API and implementation.
	Developing and bugfixing PKCS#7 (S/MIME code).
        Various X509 issues: character sets, certificate request extensions.
	Documentation for the openssl utility.

  NEEDS PATCH

    o  non-blocking socket on AIX
    o  $(PERL) in */Makefile.ssl
    o  "Sign the certificate?" - "n" creates empty certificate file

  OPEN ISSUES

    o internal_verify doesn't know about X509.v3 (basicConstraints
      CA flag ...)

    o  The Makefile hierarchy and build mechanism is still not a round thing:

       1. The config vs. Configure scripts
          It's the same nasty situation as for Apache with APACI vs.
          src/Configure. It confuses.
          Suggestion: Merge Configure and config into a single configure
                      script with a Autoconf style interface ;-) and remove
                      Configure and config. Or even let us use GNU Autoconf
                      itself. Then we can avoid a lot of those platform checks
                      which are currently in Configure.

    o  Support for Shared Libraries has to be added at least
       for the major Unix platforms. The details we can rip from the stuff
       Ralf has done for the Apache src/Configure script. Ben wants the
       solution to be really simple.

       Status: Ralf will look how we can easily incorporate the
               compiler PIC and linker DSO flags from Apache
               into the OpenSSL Configure script.

               Ulf: +1 for using GNU autoconf and libtool (but not automake,
                    which apparently is not flexible enough to generate
                    libcrypto)


    o  The perl/ stuff needs a major overhaul. Currently it's
       totally obsolete. Either we clean it up and enhance it to be up-to-date
       with the C code or we also could replace it with the really nice
       Net::SSLeay package we can find under
       http://www.neuronio.pt/SSLeay.pm.html.  Ralf uses this package for a
       longer time and it works fine and is a nice Perl module. Best would be
       to convince the author to work for the OpenSSL project and create a
       Net::OpenSSL or Crypt::OpenSSL package out of it and maintains it for
       us.

       Status: Ralf thinks we should both contact the author of Net::SSLeay
               and look how much effort it is to bring Eric's perl/ stuff up
               to date.
               Paul +1

    o The EVP and ASN1 stuff is a mess. Currently you have one EVP_CIPHER
      structure for each cipher. This may make sense for things like DES but
      for variable length ciphers like RC2 and RC4 it is NBG. Need a way to
      use the EVP interface and set up the cipher parameters. The ASN1 stuff
      is also foo wrt ciphers whose AlgorithmIdentifier has more than just
      an IV in it (e.g. RC2, RC5). This also means that EVP_Seal and EVP_Open
      don't work unless the key length matches the fixed value (some vendors
      use a key length decided by the size of the RSA encrypted key and expect
      RC2 to adapt).

    o ERR_error_string(..., buf) does not know how large buf is,
      there should be ERR_error_string_n(..., buf, bufsize)
      or similar.
