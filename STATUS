  RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS

  AVAILABLE PATCHES

    o CA.pl patch (Damien Miller)

  IN PROGRESS

    o Steve is currently working on (in no particular order):
        ASN1 code redesign, butchery, replacement.
        EVP cipher enhancement.
        Proper (or at least usable) certificate chain verification.
	Private key, certificate and CRL API and implementation.
	Developing and bugfixing PKCS#7 (S/MIME code).
        Various X509 issues: character sets, certificate request extensions.
    o Geoff and Richard are currently working on:
	ENGINE (the new code that gives hardware support among others).
    o Richard is currently working on:
	UTIL (a new set of library functions to support some higher level
	      functionality that is currently missing).
	Dynamic thread-lock support.
	Shared library support for VMS.

  NEEDS PATCH

    o  non-blocking socket on AIX
    o  $(PERL) in */Makefile.ssl
    o  "Sign the certificate?" - "n" creates empty certificate file

  OPEN ISSUES

    o internal_verify doesn't know about X509.v3 (basicConstraints
      CA flag ...)

    o  The Makefile hierarchy and build mechanism is still not a round thing:

       1. The config vs. Configure scripts
          It's the same nasty situation as for Apache with APACI vs.
          src/Configure. It confuses.
          Suggestion: Merge Configure and config into a single configure
                      script with a Autoconf style interface ;-) and remove
                      Configure and config. Or even let us use GNU Autoconf
                      itself. Then we can avoid a lot of those platform checks
                      which are currently in Configure.

    o  Support for Shared Libraries has to be added at least
       for the major Unix platforms. The details we can rip from the stuff
       Ralf has done for the Apache src/Configure script. Ben wants the
       solution to be really simple.

       Status: Ralf will look how we can easily incorporate the
               compiler PIC and linker DSO flags from Apache
               into the OpenSSL Configure script.

               Ulf: +1 for using GNU autoconf and libtool (but not automake,
                    which apparently is not flexible enough to generate
                    libcrypto)


    o  The perl/ stuff needs a major overhaul. Currently it's
       totally obsolete. Either we clean it up and enhance it to be up-to-date
       with the C code or we also could replace it with the really nice
       Net::SSLeay package we can find under
       http://www.neuronio.pt/SSLeay.pm.html.  Ralf uses this package for a
       longer time and it works fine and is a nice Perl module. Best would be
       to convince the author to work for the OpenSSL project and create a
       Net::OpenSSL or Crypt::OpenSSL package out of it and maintains it for
       us.

       Status: Ralf thinks we should both contact the author of Net::SSLeay
               and look how much effort it is to bring Eric's perl/ stuff up
               to date.
               Paul +1
