  RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS

    o BIGNUM library failures on 64-bit platforms (0.9.7-dev):
      - BN_mod_mul verificiation (bc) fails for solaris64-sparcv9-cc
        and other 64-bit platforms

	Checked on			Result
	alpha-cc (Tru64 version 4.0)	works
	linux-alpha+bwx-gcc		doesn't work. Reported by
					Sean O'Riordain <seanpor@acm.org>
	OpenBSD-sparc64			doesn't work.  BN_mod_mul breaks.

	Needs checked on
	[add platforms here]

      - BN_mod_mul verification fails for mips3-sgi-irix
        unless configured with no-asm

  AVAILABLE PATCHES

    o 

  IN PROGRESS

    o Steve is currently working on (in no particular order):
        ASN1 code redesign, butchery, replacement.
        OCSP
        EVP cipher enhancement.
        Enhanced certificate chain verification.
	Private key, certificate and CRL API and implementation.
	Developing and bugfixing PKCS#7 (S/MIME code).
        Various X509 issues: character sets, certificate request extensions.
    o Geoff and Richard are currently working on:
	ENGINE (the new code that gives hardware support among others).
    o Richard is currently working on:
	UI (User Interface)
	UTIL (a new set of library functions to support some higher level
	      functionality that is currently missing).
	Shared library support for VMS.
	Kerberos 5 authentication
	Constification
	OCSP

  NEEDS PATCH

    o  inappropriate AlgorithmIdentifier used in S/MIME signatures
       (key type instead of signature algorithm)

    o  AES ciphersuites are not (yet) official and should not be enabled
       unless explicitly requested

    o  apps/ca.c: "Sign the certificate?" - "n" creates empty certificate file

    o  "OpenSSL STATUS" is never up-to-date.

  OPEN ISSUES

    o  Do we want the EVP API changes in 0.9.7?
       Can compatibility be improved?

    o  The Makefile hierarchy and build mechanism is still not a round thing:

       1. The config vs. Configure scripts
          It's the same nasty situation as for Apache with APACI vs.
          src/Configure. It confuses.
          Suggestion: Merge Configure and config into a single configure
                      script with a Autoconf style interface ;-) and remove
                      Configure and config. Or even let us use GNU Autoconf
                      itself. Then we can avoid a lot of those platform checks
                      which are currently in Configure.

    o  Support for Shared Libraries has to be added at least
       for the major Unix platforms. The details we can rip from the stuff
       Ralf has done for the Apache src/Configure script. Ben wants the
       solution to be really simple.

       Status: Ralf will look how we can easily incorporate the
               compiler PIC and linker DSO flags from Apache
               into the OpenSSL Configure script.

               Ulf: +1 for using GNU autoconf and libtool (but not automake,
                    which apparently is not flexible enough to generate
                    libcrypto)

  WISHES

    o  Add variants of DH_generate_parameters() and BN_generate_prime() [etc?]
       where the callback function can request that the function be aborted.
       [Gregory Stark <ghstark@pobox.com>, <rayyang2000@yahoo.com>]

    o  SRP in TLS.
       [wished by:
        Dj <derek@yo.net>, Tom Wu <tom@arcot.com>,
        Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp>]

       See http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-srp-00.txt
       as well as http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/srp/.

       Tom Holroyd tells us there is a SRP patch for OpenSSH at
       http://members.tripod.com/professor_tom/archives/, that could
       be useful.
