# Format man pages without loading Pod::Man once per page.  pod2man is a
# perl program that compiles Pod::Man before it reads a single pod, and
# OpenSSL has over nine hundred pages, so running it once per page spends
# most of that time compiling the same module again and again.  Here the
# module is loaded once and the pages are then divided between a few
# forked workers, which inherit it already compiled.

# Options.  The whole manual is formatted in one run, so the section of
# each page is taken from the directory its pod lives in rather than
# given on the command line: doc/man3/BIO_s_mem.pod is section 3 and
# becomes OUTDIR/man3/BIO_s_mem.3.
