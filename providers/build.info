# We place all implementations in static libraries, and then let the
# provider mains pilfer what they want through symbol resolution when
# linking.
#
# The non-legacy implementations (libimplementations) must be made FIPS
# agnostic as much as possible, as well as the common building blocks
# (libcommon).  The legacy implementations (liblegacy) will never be
# part of the FIPS provider.
#
# If there is anything that isn't FIPS agnostic, it should be set aside
# in its own source file, which is then included directly into other
# static libraries geared for FIPS and non-FIPS providers, and built
# separately.
#
# libcommon.a           Contains common building blocks, potentially
#                       needed both by non-legacy and legacy code.
#
# libimplementations.a  Contains all non-legacy implementations.
# liblegacy.a           Contains all legacy implementations.
#
# libfips.a             Contains all things needed to support
#                       FIPS implementations, such as code from
#                       crypto/ and object files that contain
#                       FIPS-specific code.  FIPS_MODE is defined
#                       for this library.  The FIPS module uses
#                       this.
# libnonfips.a          Corresponds to libfips.a, but built with
#                       FIPS_MODE undefined.  The default and legacy
#                       providers use this.
