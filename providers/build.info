# We place all implementations in static libraries, and then let the
# provider mains pilfer what they want through symbol resolution when
# linking.
#
# The non-legacy implementations (libimplementations) must be made FIPS
# agnostic as much as possible, as well as the common building blocks
# (libcommon).  The legacy implementations (liblegacy) will never be
# part of the FIPS provider.
#
# If there is anything that isn't FIPS agnostic, it should be set aside
# in its own source file, which is then included directly into other
# static libraries geared for FIPS and non-FIPS providers, and built
# separately.
#
# libcommon.a           Contains common building blocks, potentially
#                       needed both by non-legacy and legacy code.
#
# libimplementations.a  Contains all non-legacy implementations.
# liblegacy.a           Contains all legacy implementations.
#
# libfips.a             Contains all things needed to support
#                       FIPS implementations, such as code from
#                       crypto/ and object files that contain
#                       FIPS-specific code.  FIPS_MODULE is defined
#                       for this library.  The FIPS module uses
#                       this.
# libnonfips.a          Corresponds to libfips.a, but built with
#                       FIPS_MODULE undefined.  The default and legacy
#                       providers use this.
#
# This is how different provider modules should be linked:
#
# FIPS:
#     -o fips.so {object files...} libimplementations.a libcommon.a libfips.a
# Non-FIPS:
#     -o module.so {object files...} libimplementations.a libcommon.a libnonfips.a
#
# It is crucial that code that checks for the FIPS_MODULE macro end up in
# libfips.a and libnonfips.a, never in libcommon.a.
# It is crucial that such code is written so libfips.a and libnonfips.a doesn't
# end up depending on libimplementations.a or libcommon.a.
# It is crucial that such code is written so libcommon.a doesn't end up
# depending on libimplementations.a.
#
# Code in providers/implementations/ should be written in such a way that the
# OSSL_DISPATCH arrays (and preferably the majority of the actual code) ends
# up in either libimplementations.a or liblegacy.a.
# If need be, write an abstraction layer in separate source files and make them
# libfips.a / libnonfips.a sources.
