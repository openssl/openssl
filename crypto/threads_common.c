 * @brief Thread-local context-specific data management for OpenSSL
 *
 * This file implements a mechanism to store and retrieve context-specific
 * data using OpenSSL's thread-local storage (TLS) system. It provides a way
 * to associate and manage data based on a combination of a thread-local key
 * and an `OSSL_LIB_CTX *` context.
 *
 * NOTE: This differs from the CRYPTO_THREAD_[get|set]_local api set in that
 * this api stores a single OS level thread-local key per-process, and manages
 * subsequent keys using a series of arrays and sparse arrays stored against
 * that aforementioned thread local key
 *
 * Data Design:
 *
 * per-thread master key data  -> +--------------+-+
 *                                |              | |
 *                                |              | |
 *                                +--------------+ |
 *                                +--------------+ |
 *                                |              | |
 *                                |              | |
 *                                +--------------+ |  fixed  array indexed
 *                                       .         |      by key id
 *                                       .         |
 *                                       .         |
 *                                +--------------+ |
 *                                |              | |
 *                                |       |      | |
 *                                +-------+------+-+
 *                                        |
 *           ++---------------+           |
 *           ||               |<----------+
 *           ||               |
 *           |+---------------+
 *           |+---------------+
 *           ||               |
 *           ||               |  sparse array indexed
 *           |+---------------+     by libctx pointer
 *           |        .              cast to uintptr_t
 *           |        .
 *           |        .
 *           |+---------------+
 *           ||        +------+----> +-----------------+
 *           ||        |      |      |                 |
 *           ++--------+------+      +-----------------+
 *                                  per-<thread*ctx> data
 *
 * It uses the following lookup pattern:
 *   1) A global os defined key to a per-thread fixed array
 *   2) A libcrypto defined key id as an index to (1) to get a sparse array
 *   3) A Library context pointer as an index to (2) to produce a per
 *      thread*context data pointer
 *
 * Two primary functions are provided:
 *   - CRYPTO_THREAD_get_local_ex() retrieves data associated with a key and
 *     context.
 *   - CRYPTO_THREAD_set_local_ex() associates data with a given key and
 *     context, allocating tables as needed.
 *
 * Internal structures:
 *   - CTX_TABLE_ENTRY: wraps a context-specific data pointer.
 *   - MASTER_KEY_ENTRY: maintains a table of CTX_TABLE_ENTRY and an optional
 *     cleanup function.
 *
 * The implementation ensures:
 *   - Lazy initialization of master key data using CRYPTO_ONCE.
 *   - Automatic cleanup of all context and key mappings when a thread exits.
 *
 * Cleanup routines:
 *   - clean_ctx_entry: releases context-specific entries.
 *   - clean_master_key_id: releases all entries for a specific key ID.
 *   - clean_master_key: top-level cleanup for the thread-local master key.
