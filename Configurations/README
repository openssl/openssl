Configurations of OpenSSL target platforms
------------------------------------------

Target configurations are a collection of facts that we know about
different platforms and their capabilities.  We organise them in a
hash table, where each entry represent a specific target.

In each table entry, the following keys are significant:

        inherit_from    => Other targets to inherit values from.
                           Explained further below. [1]
        template        => Set to 1 if this isn't really a platform
                           target.  Instead, this target is a template
                           upon which other targets can be built.
                           Explained further below.  [1]

        sys_id          => System identity for systems where that
                           is difficult to determine automatically.

        cc              => The compiler command, usually one of "cc",
                           "gcc" or "clang".  This command is normally
                           also used to link object files and
                           libraries into the final program.
        cflags          => Flags that are used at all times when
                           compiling.
        debug_cflags    => Extra compilation flags used when making a
                           debug build (when Configure receives the
                           --debug option).  Typically something like
                           "-g -O0".
        release_cflags  => Extra compilation flags used when making a
                           release build (when Configure receives the
                           --release option, or doesn't receive the
                           --debug option).  Typically something like
                           "-O" or "-O3".
        thread_cflags   => Extra compilation flags used when
                           compiling with threading enabled.
                           Explained further below.  [2]
        shared_cflag    => Extra compilation flags used when
                           compiling for shared libraries, typically
                           something like "-fPIC".

        ld              => the linker command, usually not defined
                           (meaning the compiler command is used
                           instead).
                           (NOTE: this is here for future use, it's
                           not implemented yet)
        lflags          => the flags that are used at all times when
                           linking.  These can have a % sign in them
                           showing where the OpenSSL libraries should
                           appear, otherwise these flags will come
                           last.  So in a typical links situation,
                           this is a quick table of results:

                           "-foo%-bar"  > -foo -lssl -lcrypto -bar
                           "-foo%"      > -foo -lssl -lcrypto
                           "-foo"       > -lssl -lcrypto -foo

        debug_lflags    => Like debug_cflags, but used when linking.
        release_lflags  => Like release_cflags, but used when linking.
        shared_lflags   => Like shared_cflags, but used when linking.

        ar              => The library archive command, the default is
                           "ar".
                           (NOTE: this is here for future use, it's
                           not implemented yet)
        arflags         => Flags to be used with the library archive
                           command.

        ranlib          => The library archive indexing command, the
                           default is 'ranlib' it it exists.

        unistd          => An alternative header to the typical
                           '<unistd.h>'.  This is very rarely needed.

        shared_extension => File name extension used for shared
                            libraries. 
        obj_extension   => File name extension used for object files.
                           On unix, this defaults to ".o" (NOTE: this
                           is here for future use, it's not
                           implemented yet)
        exe_extension   => File name extension used for executable
                           files.  On unix, this defaults to "" (NOTE:
                           this is here for future use, it's not
                           implemented yet)

        dso_scheme      => The type of dynamic shared objects to build
                           for.  This mostly comes into play with
                           engines, but can be used for other purposes
                           as well.  Valid values are "DLFCN"
                           (dlopen() et al), "DLFCN_NO_H" (for systems
                           that use dlopen() et al but do not have
                           fcntl.h), "DL" (shl_load() et al), "WIN32"
                           and "VMS".
        perlasm_scheme  => The perlasm method used to created the
                           assembler files used when compiling with
                           assembler implementations.
        shared_target   => The shared library building method used.
                           This is a target found in Makefile.shared.
        build_scheme    => The scheme used to build up a Makefile.
                           In its simplest form, the value is a string
                           with the name of the build scheme.
                           The value may also take the form of a list
                           of strings, if the build_scheme is to have
                           some options.  In this case, the first
                           string in the list is the name of the build
                           scheme.
                           Currently recognised build schemes are
                           "mk1mf" and "unixmake".  Others may appear
                           in the future.

        multilib        => On systems that support having multiple
                           implementations of a library (typically a
                           32-bit and a 64-bit variant), this is used
                           to have the different variants in different
                           directories.

        bn_ops          => Building options (was just bignum options
                           in the earlier history of this option,
                           hence the name).  This a string of words
                           that describe properties on the designated
                           target platform, such as the type of
                           integers used to build up the bitnum,
                           different ways to implement certain ciphers
                           and so on.  To fully comprehend the
                           meaning, the best is to read the affected
                           source.
                           The valid words are:

                           DES_PTR      use a pointer to DES_SPtrans
                                        rather that DES_SPtrans
                                        directly in D_ENCRYPT.
                           DES_RISC1    Alternate implementations of
                           DES_RISC2    D_ENCRYPT for certain RISC
                                        processors.
                           DES_UNROLL   do not loop around calls to
                                        D_ENCRYPT.
                           DES_INT      have unsigned int as the
                                        integer type for DES rather
                                        than unsigned long.
                           BN_LLONG     use 'unsigned long long' in
                                        some bignum calculations.
                                        This has no value when
                                        SIXTY_FOUR_BIT or
                                        SIXTY_FOUR_BIT_LONG is given.
                           RC4_CHAR     makes the basic RC4 unif of
                                        calculation an unsigned char.

                                        rather than incrementing the
                                        pointer.
                           RC4_CHUNK    sets the chunk type to
                                        unsigned long.

                                        unsigned long long.
                                        both these chunk sizes are for
                                        handling data in chunks on
                                        processors that do not have
                                        byte load/store instructions.
                           MD2_CHAR     makes the basic MD2 unit of
                                        calculation an unsigned char.

                                        calculation an unsigned short.
                           RC2_LONG     makes the basic RC2 unit of
                                        calculation an unsigned long.
                           BF_PTR       use different pointer based
                           BF_PTR2      versions of BF_ENC.
                           SIXTY_FOUR_BIT       processor registers
                                                are 64 bits, long is
                                                32 bits, long long is
                                                64 bits.
                           SIXTY_FOUR_BIT_LONG  processor registers

[1] as part of the target configuration, one can have a key called
    'inherit_from' that indicate what other configurations to inherit
    data from.  These are resolved recursively.

    Inheritance works as a set of default values that can be overriden
    by corresponding key values in the inheriting configuration.

    Note 1: any configuration table can be used as a template.
    Note 2: pure templates have the attribute 'template => 1' and
            cannot be used as build targets.

    If several configurations are given in the 'inherit_from' array,
    the values of same attribute are concatenated with space
    separation.  With this, it's possible to have several smaller
    templates for different configuration aspects that can be combined
    into a complete configuration.

    instead of a scalar value or an array, a value can be a code block
    of the form 'sub { /* your code here */ }'.  This code block will
    be called with the list of inherited values for that key as
    arguments.  In fact, the concatenation of strings is really done
    by using 'sub { join(" ",@_) }' on the list of inherited values.

    An example:

        "foo" => {
                template => 1,
                haha => "ha ha",
                hoho => "ho",
                ignored => "This should not appear in the end result",
        },
        "bar" => {
                template => 1,
                haha => "ah",
                hoho => "haho",
                hehe => "hehe"
        },
        "laughter" => {
                inherit_from => [ "foo", "bar" ],
                hehe => sub { join(" ",(@_,"!!!")) },
                ignored => "",
        }

        The entry for "laughter" will become as follows after processing:

        "laughter" => {
                haha => "ha ha ah",
                hoho => "ho haho",
                hehe => "hehe !!!",
                ignored => ""
        }

[2] OpenSSL is built with threading capabilities unless the user
    specifies 'no-threads'.  The value of the key 'thread_cflags' may
    be "(unknown)", in which case the user MUST give some compilation
    flags to Configure.


Historically, the target configurations came in form of a string with
values separated by colons.  This use is deprecated, although
currently somewhat supported.  The string form looks like this:

   "target" => "{cc}:{cflags}:{unistd}:{thread_cflag}:{sys_id}:{lflags}:{bn_ops}:{cpuid_obj}:{bn_obj}:{ec_obj}:{des_obj}:{aes_obj}:{bf_obj}:{md5_obj}:{sha1_obj}:{cast_obj}:{rc4_obj}:{rmd160_obj}:{rc5_obj}:{wp_obj}:{cmll_obj}:{modes_obj}:{engines_obj}:{perlasm_scheme}:{dso_scheme}:{shared_target}:{shared_cflag}:{shared_ldflag}:{shared_extension}:{ranlib}:{arflags}:{multilib}"
