    # Contemporary Android applications can provide multiple JNI
    # providers in .apk, targeting multiple architectures. Among
    # them there is "place" for two ARM flavours: generic eabi and
    # armv7-a/hard-float. However, it should be noted that OpenSSL's
    # ability to engage NEON is not constrained by ABI choice, nor
    # is your ability to call OpenSSL from your application code
    # compiled with floating-point ABI other than default 'soft'.
    # [Latter thanks to __attribute__((pcs("aapcs"))) declaration.]
    # This means that choice of ARM libraries you provide in .apk
    # is driven by application needs. For example if application
    # itself benefits from NEON or is floating-point intensive, then
    # it might be appropriate to provide both libraries. Otherwise
    # just generic eabi would do. But in latter case it would be
    # appropriate to
    #
    #   ./Configure android-armeabi -D__ARM_MAX_ARCH__=8
    #
    # in order to build "universal" binary and allow OpenSSL take
    # advantage of NEON when it's available.
