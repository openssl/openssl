# Purpose: Create an introductory training guide explaining how CMS works and how pieces fit together
documentPurpose:
  - understandSystem  # PRIMARY: Explain how CMS works and architecture
  - getStarted        # Help users start using CMS functionality
  - completeTasks     # Guide through common CMS workflows (sign, verify, encrypt, decrypt)
  - findAnswers       # Reference for 31+ undocumented functions

# Target Audience: Developers learning CMS
targetAudienceTypes:
  - developers        # PRIMARY: Engineers integrating CMS into their projects
  - decisionMakers    # Architects evaluating CMS for secure messaging

# Reader Knowledge Level: New to CMS but familiar with cryptography basics
readerKnowledgeLevel: domainFamiliar  # Know cryptography concepts, new to CMS specifically

# Documentation Depth: Comprehensive coverage including undocumented functions
documentationDepth: comprehensive  # Cover all features, including the 31 undocumented functions

# Custom Rules: Specific requirements for CMS training guide

  1. INTRODUCTORY FOCUS:
     - Explain what CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax - RFC 5652) is and why it exists
     - Cover the fundamental concepts and architecture
     - Show how all the pieces (SignedData, EnvelopedData, DigestedData, etc.) fit together
     - Provide clear conceptual flow before diving into API details

  2. STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION:
     - Start with high-level overview of CMS capabilities
     - Explain the 6 content types: Data, SignedData, EnvelopedData, DigestedData, EncryptedData, AuthEnvelopedData
     - Cover the 6 recipient types: Trans, Agree, KEK, Pass, Other, KEM
     - Show relationships between command-line tool and library functions

  3. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:
     - Use demos/cms/*.c examples to illustrate real-world usage
     - Show complete workflows: sign → verify, encrypt → decrypt, compress → uncompress
     - Include command-line examples from openssl cms tool
     - Demonstrate common patterns and best practices

  4. UNDOCUMENTED FUNCTIONS:
     - Explicitly document the 31+ functions that lack reference documentation
     - Extract function signatures, parameters, return values from cms.h.in
     - Infer usage from implementation in crypto/cms/*.c files
     - Note which functions are public API vs internal

  5. BRIDGE EXISTING DOCS:
     - Reference existing doc/man3/CMS_*.pod documentation where it exists
     - Fill gaps for undocumented functionality
     - Connect command-line flags to underlying API functions

  6. VISUAL AIDS:
     - Create diagrams showing CMS message structure
     - Illustrate signing/verification flow
     - Show encryption/decryption with different recipient types
     - Map command-line operations to library function calls

  7. TROUBLESHOOTING:
     - Common errors and solutions
     - Flag combinations and their effects
     - Certificate/key requirements for each operation

# Target Audience Details
targetAudience: |
  Developers and engineers who need to:
  - Implement secure message signing and encryption using OpenSSL CMS
  - Understand how CMS works conceptually before using the API
  - Learn the relationships between different CMS components
  - Find documentation for currently undocumented functions
  - Transition from command-line tool usage to programmatic API usage

  Assumes basic knowledge of:
  - Cryptographic concepts (signatures, encryption, certificates)
  - C programming for API usage
  - Command-line tools for practical examples

# Glossary for CMS-specific terms
glossary: |
  **CMS**: Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652) - Standard for cryptographically protecting messages
  **SignedData**: CMS content type for digitally signed messages
  **EnvelopedData**: CMS content type for encrypted messages with recipient info
  **AuthEnvelopedData**: Authenticated encryption with associated data
  **DigestedData**: CMS content type containing a message digest
  **EncryptedData**: Simple symmetric encryption without recipient info
  **RecipientInfo**: Information about message recipients (6 types: KTRI, KARI, KEKRI, PWRI, ORI, KEMRI)
  **SignerInfo**: Information about message signers
  **S/MIME**: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions using CMS
  **KTRI**: Key Transport Recipient Info (RSA-based)
  **KARI**: Key Agreement Recipient Info (DH/ECDH-based)
  **KEKRI**: Key Encryption Key Recipient Info (symmetric key wrap)
  **PWRI**: Password Recipient Info (password-based encryption)
  **KEMRI**: KEM Recipient Info (Key Encapsulation Mechanism - quantum-resistant)
  **ORI**: Other Recipient Info (custom/future recipient types)
