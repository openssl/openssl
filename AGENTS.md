## 🚨 AI Policy & Operations

Extracted from CONTRIBUTING.md - operational constraints and procedures.

### AI Policy

- cannot be merged a piece at a time, and leaves every change in it blocked
- guidelines:
- using an AI tool, you must declare which agent and model were used.
- This is done by adding `Assisted-by: {agent}:{model}` below the commit
- Policy] if an AI model assisted with the creation of your

### Key Requirements

- understand what changed and why without needing to reference related
- (that are not just a rebase) will require re-approval.
- 1. Anything other than a trivial contribution requires a [Contributor
- If your contribution is too small to require a CLA (e.g., fixing a spelling
- You will need to have signed a v1.1 or later CLA in order to

### Development Procedures

- at least two committers, and a batch of them submitted together does not get
- behind the one a reviewer disagrees with.  Each pull request should address
- one logical change (perhaps spread across multiple commits); what has to give
- draft of it.  Before opening a pull request you must have read the
- change in full, understood why it is correct, built and tested it



## 🏗️ Architecture & Context Guide

This section provides architectural context and agent-understanding for the codebase.

### Prerequisites

- **C:** 3.9+ (or applicable language version)
- **Package Manager:** pip or uv
- **Test Runner:** None detected

### Architecture Overview

#### Key Components
- **Main Entry:** Standard layout
- **Test Suite:** 2292 test files
- **Build Configuration:** Makefile, Makefile, Makefile

#### Design Principles

1. **Modularity** - Code organized by functionality with clear separation of concerns
2. **Testability** - Comprehensive test coverage across critical paths
3. **Clarity** - Explicit naming and structure for AI agent understanding
4. **Consistency** - Uniform patterns and conventions throughout codebase
5. **Maintainability** - Well-documented code with clear intent

### Development Workflow

#### Initial Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/openssl.git
cd openssl
pip install -e .
# or
uv sync --all-groups
```

#### Development Commands

**Running Tests:**
```bash
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest tests/             # Run specific test directory
pytest -v                 # Verbose output with test names
pytest -x                 # Stop on first failure
coverage run -m pytest && coverage report  # With coverage report
```

#### Code Quality
```bash
ruff check .              # Lint with ruff
ruff format .             # Format code
mypy .                    # Type checking (if configured)
```

### Code Style & Conventions

- **Naming:** Use C conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for classes)
- **Type Hints:** Yes (strongly encouraged)
- **Error Handling:** Yes - handle errors at boundaries; let exceptions propagate when another layer owns recovery
- **Logging:** No
- **Testing:** Yes - write tests alongside code changes

### Testing Strategy

**Framework:** None detected
**Test Files:** 2292 found

Before committing:
1. Run the full test suite: `pytest`
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Check type hints: `mypy .`
4. Format code: `ruff format .`

### Writing Documentation

When updating docs:
1. Always include explanatory text before code snippets
2. Describe *why* and *what* before showing *how*
3. Keep sections focused on a single concept
4. Use clear, concrete examples

### Contributing Guidelines

This project has a detailed contribution guide at **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**.

**Key Requirements:**
- **Performance Work**: Requires benchmarks and performance metrics in PR description

**Before submitting:**
1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` in full
2. Check recent merged PRs for patterns
3. Follow the specific requirements above

### Common Patterns

When contributing to this project:
1. Read existing code in the area you're modifying
2. Follow the established patterns and style
3. Write tests for new functionality
4. Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
5. Add docstrings for public APIs
6. Update tests when changing behavior

### What We Value

✅ Well-tested code with clear intent
✅ Consistent code style and naming conventions
✅ Code that is easy for AI agents to understand
✅ Clear, descriptive commit messages
✅ Modular, reusable components
✅ Comprehensive documentation

### What We Avoid

❌ Large functions doing multiple things
❌ Commented-out dead code
❌ Inconsistent naming or patterns
❌ Unclear error messages
❌ Unexplained magic numbers or strings
❌ Skipped tests or test TODOs

### AI Readiness Dimensions (Scoring)

This project is evaluated across 8 dimensions:

1. **Architecture** (10/100) - Code organization and modularity
2. **Testing** (15/100) - Test coverage and quality
3. **Dependencies** (12/100) - Dependency management
4. **Conventions** (6/100) - Consistent patterns
5. **Entry Points** (4/100) - Clear main/start locations
6. **Security** (10/100) - Input validation and error handling
7. **Build** (10/100) - Clear build/setup instructions
8. **Documentation** (8/100) - Code and project documentation

### Next Steps

Before making changes:
1. Read relevant source files to understand the existing code
2. Look at existing tests for similar functionality
3. Follow the patterns you see in the codebase
4. Write tests for your changes
5. Run `pytest` to verify nothing breaks
6. Run code quality checks: `ruff check . && mypy .`
7. Format your code: `ruff format .`
