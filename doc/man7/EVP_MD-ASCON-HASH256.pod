=head1 NAME

EVP_MD-ASCON-HASH256 - The Ascon-Hash256 EVP_MD implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing Ascon-Hash256 digests through the B<EVP_MD> API.

=head2 Algorithm Names

The following algorithms are available in the default provider:

=over 4
=item "ASCON-HASH256"

=item "ascon-hash256"

=back

=head2 Parameters

This implementation supports the parameters described in L<EVP_DigestInit(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=head1 NOTES

Ascon-Hash256 is the NIST-standardized hash algorithm specified in NIST SP 800-232.
It is based on the Ascon family of algorithms, suitable for lightweight and
constrained environments.

Ascon-Hash256 produces a fixed 256-bit (32-byte) output digest using the
Ascon-p[12] permutation. The implementation processes data in 8-byte blocks.

=head1 CONFORMING TO

=over 4

=head1 HISTORY

Ascon-Hash256 was added in OpenSSL 4.X

This implementation conforms to the NIST SP 800-232 specification for
Ascon-Hash256.
