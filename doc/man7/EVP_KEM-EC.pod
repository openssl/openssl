=head1 NAME

EVP_KEM-EC
- EVP_KEM EC keytype and algorithm support

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<EC> keytype and its parameters are described in L<EVP_PKEY-EC(7)>.
See L<EVP_PKEY_encapsulate(3)> and L<EVP_PKEY_decapsulate(3)> for more info.

=head2 EC KEM parameters

=over 4

=item "operation" (B<OSSL_KEM_PARAM_OPERATION>)<UTF8 string>

The OpenSSL EC Key Encapsulation Mechanisms only supports the
following default operation (operating mode):

=over 4

=item "DHKEM" (B<OSSL_KEM_PARAM_OPERATION_DHKEM>)

The encapsulate function generates an ephemeral keypair. It produces keymaterial
by doing an ECDH key exchange using the ephemeral private key and a supplied
recipient public key. A HKDF operation using the keymaterial and a kem context
then produces a shared secret. The shared secret and the ephemeral public key
are returned.
The decapsulate function uses the recipient private key and the
ephemeral public key to produce the same keymaterial, which can then be used to
produce the same shared secret.
See L<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html#name-dh-based-kem-dhkem>

=back

This can be set using either EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_kem_op() or
EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params().

=item "ikme" (B<OSSL_KEM_PARAM_IKME>) <octet string>

Used to specify the key material used for generation of the ephemeral key.
This value should not be reused for other purposes.
It can only be used for the curves "P-256", "P-384" and "P-521" and should
have a length of at least the size of the encoded private key
(i.e. 32, 48 and 66 for the listed curves).
If this value is not set, then a random ikm is used.

=head1 HISTORY

This functionality was added in OpenSSL 3.2.

The C<operation> (operating mode) was a required parameter prior to OpenSSL 3.5.
As of OpenSSL 3.5, C<DHKEM> is the default operating mode, and no explicit value
need be specified.
