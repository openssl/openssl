=head1 NAME

EVP_MAC-Poly1305 - The Poly1305 EVP_MAC implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing Poly1305 MACs through the B<EVP_MAC> API.

=head2 Identity

This implementation is identified with this name and properties, to be
used with EVP_MAC_fetch():

=over 4

=item "POLY1305", "provider=default"

=back

=head2 Supported parameters

The general description of these parameters can be found in
L<EVP_MAC(3)/PARAMETERS>.

The following parameter can be set with EVP_MAC_CTX_set_params():

=over 4

=item "key" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_KEY>) <octet string>

=back

The following parameters can be retrieved with
EVP_MAC_CTX_get_params():

=over 4

=item "size" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_SIZE>) <unsigned integer>

=back

The "size" parameter can also be retrieved with with EVP_MAC_CTX_get_mac_size().
The length of the "size" parameter should not exceed that of an B<unsigned int>.
