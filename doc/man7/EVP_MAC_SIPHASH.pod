=head1 NAME

EVP_MAC_SIPHASH - The SipHash EVP_MAC implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing SipHash MACs through the B<EVP_MAC> API.

=head2 Numeric identity

B<EVP_MAC_SIPHASH> is the numeric identity for this implementation,
and can be used in functions like EVP_MAC_CTX_new_id() and
EVP_get_macbynid().

=head2 Supported controls

The supported controls are:

=over 4

=item B<EVP_MAC_CTRL_SET_SIZE>

EVP_MAC_ctrl_str() type string: "digestsize"

The value string is expected to contain a decimal number.

=item B<EVP_MAC_CTRL_SET_KEY>

EVP_MAC_ctrl_str() takes two type strings for this control:

=over 4

=item "key"

The value string is used as is.

=item "hexkey"

The value string is expected to be a hexadecimal number, which will be
decoded before passing on as control value.
