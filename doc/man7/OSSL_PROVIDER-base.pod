=head1 NAME

OSSL_PROVIDER-base - OpenSSL base provider

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OpenSSL base provider supplies the encoding for OpenSSL's
asymmetric cryptography.

=head2 Properties

The implementations in this provider specifically have this property
defined:

=over 4

=item "provider=base"

=back

It may be used in a property query string with fetching functions.

It isn't mandatory to query for this property, except to make sure to get
implementations of this provider and none other.

=over 4

=item "type=parameters"

=item "type=private"

=item "type=public"

=back

These may be used in a property query string with fetching functions to select
which data are to be encoded.  Either the private key material, the public
key material or the domain parameters can be selected.

=over 4

=item "format=der"

=item "format=pem"

=item "format=text"

=back

These may be used in a property query string with fetching functions to select
the encoding output format.  Either the DER, PEM and plaintext are
currently permitted.

=head1 OPERATIONS AND ALGORITHMS

The OpenSSL base provider supports these operations and algorithms:

=head2 Random Number Generation

=over 4

=item SEED-SRC,  see L<EVP_RAND-SEED-SRC(7)>

=item JITTER,  see L<EVP_RAND-JITTER(7)>

=back

In addition to this provider, the "SEED-SRC" and "JITTER" algorithms
are also available in the default provider.

=head2 Asymmetric Key Encoder

=over 4

=item RSA

=item RSA-PSS

=item DH

=item DHX

=item DSA

=item EC

=item ED25519

=item ED448

=item X25519

=item X448

=item SM2

=for comment TODO(ML-KEM): We don't yet have encoders for ML-KEM.

=back

In addition to this provider, all of these encoding algorithms are also
available in the default provider. Some of these algorithms may be used in
combination with the FIPS provider.

=head2 Asymmetric Key Decoder

=over 4

=item RSA

=item RSA-PSS

=item DH

=item DHX

=item DSA

=item EC

=item ED25519

=item ED448

=item X25519

=item X448

=item SM2

=item DER

=for comment We don't yet have decoders for MLKEM...

=back

In addition to this provider, all of these decoding algorithms are also
available in the default provider. Some of these algorithms may be used in
combination with the FIPS provider.

=head2 Stores

=over 4

=item file

=item org.openssl.winstore, see L<OSSL_STORE-winstore(7)>

=back

In addition to this provider, all of these store algorithms are also
available in the default provider.
