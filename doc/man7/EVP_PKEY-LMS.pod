=head1 NAME

EVP_PKEY-LMS, EVP_KEYMGMT-LMS, LMS
- EVP_PKEY Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) keytype and algorithm support

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<LMS> keytype is implemented in OpenSSL's default provider.

=head2 Common LMS parameters

LMS public keys are encoded in XDR format (i.e. not ANS1 format),
The following parameters are used by EVP_PKEY_fromdata() and by the
LMS keymanager for import and export.

=over 4

=item "encoded-pub-key" (B<OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_ENCODED_PUBLIC_KEY>) <octet string>

Used for getting and setting the encoding of an LMS public key. The public key
is expected to be in XDR format.

=head1 EXAMPLES

NOTE error checking has been omitted in these examples

An B<EVP_PKEY> context can be obtained by calling:

    EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name(libctx, "LMS", propq);

An B<LMS> public key can be loaded simply like this:

     EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL;
     OSSL_DECODER_CTX *dctx = NULL;
     int selection = OSSL_KEYMGMT_SELECT_PUBLIC_KEY;

     dctx = OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new_for_pkey(&pkey, "XDR", NULL,
                                          "LMS", selection, libctx, propq);
     ret = OSSL_DECODER_from_bio(dctx, bio);
     OSSL_DECODER_CTX_free(dctx);

To load a LMS key from XDR encoded "data" of size "datalen":

    EVP_PKEY *key = NULL;
    OSSL_PARAM params[2];

    params[0] =
        OSSL_PARAM_construct_octet_string(OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_ENCODED_PUBLIC_KEY,
                                          (unsigned char *)data, datalen);
    params[1] = OSSL_PARAM_construct_end();
    ret = EVP_PKEY_fromdata_init(ctx)
    ret = EVP_PKEY_fromdata(ctx, &key, EVP_PKEY_PUBLIC_KEY, params);
