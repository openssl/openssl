=head1 NAME

EVP_CIPHER-ASCON128 - The Ascon128 EVP_CIPHER implementations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for ASCON-128 symmetric encryption using the B<EVP_CIPHER> API

=head2 Algorithm Names

The following algorithms are available in the default provider:

=over 4

=item "ASCON128"

=item "ascon128"

=back

=head2 Parameters

This implementation supports the parameters described in L<EVP_EncryptInit(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=head1 NOTES

ASCON-128 is part of the Ascon family of algorithms selected by NIST for
standardization. It provides authenticated encryption suitable for lightweight
and constrained environments.

The algorithm supports associated data (AAD) that is authenticated but not
encrypted. AAD can be provided before encryption/decryption operations begin.
