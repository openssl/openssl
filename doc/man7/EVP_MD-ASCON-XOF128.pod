=head1 NAME

EVP_MD-ASCON-XOF128 - The Ascon-XOF128 EVP_MD implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing Ascon-XOF128 digests through the B<EVP_MD> API.

Ascon-XOF128 is an Extendable Output Function (XOF) that can produce output
of any desired length.

=head2 Algorithm Names

The following algorithms are available in the default provider:

=over 4

=item "ASCON-XOF128"

=item "ascon-xof128"

=back

=head2 Parameters

This implementation supports the following L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> entries:

=over 4

=item "xoflen" (B<OSSL_DIGEST_PARAM_XOFLEN>) <unsigned integer>

Sets or Gets the digest length for extendable output functions.
The length of the "xoflen" parameter should not exceed that of a B<size_t>.

The ASCON-XOF128 implementation does not have any default digest length.

This parameter must be set before calling either EVP_DigestFinal_ex() or
EVP_DigestFinal(), since these functions were not designed to handle variable
length output. It is recommended to either use EVP_DigestSqueeze() or
EVP_DigestFinalXOF() instead.

=item "size" (B<OSSL_DIGEST_PARAM_SIZE>) <unsigned integer>

An alias of "xoflen".

=back

See L<EVP_DigestInit(3)/PARAMETERS> for further information related to parameters

=head1 NOTES

Ascon-XOF128 is the NIST-standardized extendable output function specified in
NIST SP 800-232. It is based on the Ascon family of algorithms, suitable for
lightweight and constrained environments.

Ascon-XOF128 uses the Ascon-p[12] permutation and can produce output of any
desired length. The implementation processes data in 8-byte blocks.

For ASCON-XOF128, to ensure the maximum security strength of 128 bits, the output
length passed to EVP_DigestFinalXOF() should be at least 16.
