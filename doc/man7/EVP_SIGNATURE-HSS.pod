=head1 NAME

EVP_SIGNATURE-HSS
- The EVP_PKEY Hierarchical signature scheme (HSS) implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<HSS> EVP_PKEY implementation supports Hash-based stateful signatures
using the HSS scheme described in RFC 8554. HSS uses a tree of
Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS).

Generated HSS signature data consists of a list of signed encoded public
keys for each level in the tree, that have been signed using the parents private
keys.
As well as a LMS signature of a message that uses the leaf trees private key.
A single level HSS tree consists of just the LMS signature of a message.

The OpenSSL provider(s) currently only support signature verification as this is
a [SP 800-208](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/208/final) requirement for
FIPS software modules.

=head2 Parameters for ED25519 and ED448

=over 4

=item "mandatory-digest" (B<OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_MANDATORY_DIGEST>) <UTF8 string>

The empty string, signifying that no digest may be specified.

=back


=head1 NOTES

HSS support is disabled by default at compile-time.
To enable, specify the B<enable-hss> build configuration option.

HSS should only be used for older deployments.
New deployments should use either L<EVP_SIGNATURE-ML-DSA(7)>
or <L/EVP_SIGNATURE-SLH-DSA(7)>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Error checking has been omitted from the following examples

=head2 HSS signature verification

 /* See L<EVP_PKEY-HSS(7)/EXAMPLES for an example of loading a HSS |pub| key */
 ctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_pkey(libctx, pub, propq);
 sig = EVP_SIGNATURE_fetch(libctx, "HSS", propq);
 EVP_PKEY_verify_message_init(ctx, sig, NULL);
 /*
  * EVP_PKEY_verify_message_update() and EVP_PKEY_verify_message_final()
  * are not supported
  */
 ret = EVP_PKEY_verify(ctx, sigdata, sigdata_len, msg, msglen);
 /*
  * ret == 1 indicates success, 0 verify failure and < 0 for some
  * other error.
  */
