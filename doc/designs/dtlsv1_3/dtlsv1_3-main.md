DTLSv1.3 Design
===============

This page presents an overview of the design rationale for the DTLSv1.3
(RFC 9147) implementation in OpenSSL.

Objectives
----------

* A user should be able to establish a DTLSv1.3 connection through the same
  apis as previous versions of DTLS.
* MUSTs, SHALLs and REQUIREDs of RFC 9147 are implemented.
* Implementation details of OPTIONALs, SHOULDs and MAYs are documented in
  this document.

Implementation details
----------------------

This section describes the implementation requirements of DTLSv1.3
(RFC 9147).

### DTLSv1.0 support

RFC 9147 recommends to drop DTLSv1.0 support but OpenSSL will continue to
support it for now.

### DTLSv1.3 unified header

A new feature for DTLSv1.3 is the unified header (unified_hdr) (RFC 9147
section 4) of the DTLSCiphertext. OpenSSL supports receiving a DTLSCiphertext
of any format but always formats the header of outgoing DTLSCiphertext's the
same way:

* The C-bit is set to 0. Refer to [DTLSv1.3 connection id](#dtlsv1.3-connection-id)
* The S-bit is set to 1 (sequence numbers are 16-bit)
* The L-bit is set to 1 (length field is present)

Configurability of the unified header fields requires a new api and is marked
as a feature request in issue ###########.

### DTLSv1.3 connection id

OpenSSL does not support Connection ID's (RFC 9146). Notably Openssl DTLSv1.3 clients
will not offer the "connection_id" extension even though RFC 9147 states:

> DTLS clients which do not want to receive a Connection ID SHOULD still offer
> the "connection_id" extension [RFC9146] unless there is an application
> profile to the contrary. This permits a server which wants to receive a CID
> to negotiate one.

### Clearing retransmission queue

When the session keys are updated the DTLSv1.3 implementation will clear the
messages waiting for retransmission that belongs to the key that is being updated.

#### TLS 1.3 "compatibility mode" is not enabled

Opposed to the TLS 1.3 implementation, the DTLSv1.3 implementation does not offer
the compatibility which is in consistency with RFC9147 section 5.

This is enforced by the macro `SSL_CONNECTION_MIDDLEBOX_IS_ENABLED(sc)`.

#### Cryptographic label prefix

The DTLSv1.3 implementation uses the label "dtls1.3" as described by RFC9147
section 5.9.

#### DTLS 1.3 Epoch

The DTLSv1.3 implementation modifies the epoch according to RFC9147 section 6.1
for DTLSv1.3 connections.

Implementation progress
-----------------------

This section contains a summary of the work required to implement DTLSv1.3 for Openssl.
It is basically a condensed version of the RFC.

### Backlog of work items

A summary of larger work items that needs to be addressed.

Notice that some of the requirements mentioned in [List of DTLSv1.3 requirements](#list-of-dtls-13-requirements)
is not covered by these workitems and must be implemented separately.

| Summary                                             | #PR            |
|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| ACK messages                                        | -              |
| Use HelloRetryRequest instead of HelloVerifyRequest | #22985, #22400 |
| Message transcript                                  | -              |
| ClientHello                                         | #23320         |
| EndOfEarlyData message                              | -              |
| Variable length header                              | -              |
| DTLSv1.3 Fuzzer                                     | -              |

### Changes from DTLS 1.2 and/or TLS 1.3

In general the implementation of DTLSv1.3 reuses much of the same functionality of
TLSv1.3 and DTLSv1.2. This part of the implementation can be considered a
separate work item.

Here follows a collection of changes that need to be implemented.

#### Message Transcript

The message transcript is computed differently from DTLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3:

> In DTLSv1.3, the message transcript is computed over the original TLS 1.3-style
> Handshake messages without the message_seq, fragment_offset, and fragment_length
> values. Note that this is a change from DTLS 1.2 where those values were
> included in the transcript.

#### DTLSCipherText

DTLSCipherText differs from DTLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3:

> The DTLSCiphertext structure omits the superfluous version number and type fields
> ...
> The DTLSCiphertext structure has a variable-length header
> ...
> The entire header value shown in Figure 4 (but prior to record number encryption;
> see Section 4.2.3) is used as the additional data value for the AEAD function
> ...
> In DTLSv1.3 the 64-bit sequence_number is used as the sequence number for the
> AEAD computation; unlike DTLS 1.2, the epoch is not included.

Because of the encrypted sequence number and record number the implementation must
handle them as described in:

> 4.2.2. Reconstructing the Sequence Number and Epoch

And

> 4.2.3. Record Number Encryption

#### ClientHello

DTLS adds legacy_cookie which has a forced value. And there are changes to the
random value:

> random: Same as for TLS 1.3, except that the downgrade sentinels ... apply to
> DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.0, respectively.

#### EndOfEarlyData message

> the EndOfEarlyData message is omitted both from the wire and the handshake
> transcript

#### ACK messages

See section 7 and 8 of RFC 9147.

### List of DTLSv1.3 requirements

Here's a list of requirements from RFC 9147 together with their implementation status
and associated PR with the relevant implementation.

"TBD" indicates that the implementation is missing. Note there may exist a fix in a PR.

"Yes" indicates that the requirement is already implemented.

"No" indicates that the requirement will not be implemented. For example some requirements only
applies if the implementation supports Connection Id's.

"DTLS 1.2" indicates that the requirement is the same for DTLS 1.2 and is expected to already
have been implemented. "DTLS 1.2?" indicates that this is an optional requirement for DTLS 1.2.

"TLS 1.3" indicates that the requirement is the same for TLS 1.3 and is expected to already
have been implemented.

| Sending implementations MUST NOT mix records from multiple DTLS associations in the same datagram                                                                                       | TBD          |
| If the second or later record has a connection ID which does not correspond to the same association used for previous records, the rest of the datagram MUST be discarded               | No           |
| If the first byte is alert(21), handshake(22), or ack(proposed, 26), the record MUST be interpreted as a DTLSPlaintext record                                                           | TBD          |
| If the first byte is any other value, then receivers MUST check to see if the leading bits of the first byte are 001                                                                    | TBD          |
| If so, the implementation MUST process the record as DTLSCiphertext; the true content type will be inside the protected portion                                                         | TBD          |

| Implementations MUST send retransmissions of lost messages using the same epoch and keying material as the original transmission                                                        | TBD          |
| Implementations MUST either abandon an association or rekey prior to allowing the sequence number to wrap.                                                                              | DTLS 1.2?    |
