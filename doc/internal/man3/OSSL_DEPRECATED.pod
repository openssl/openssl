=head1 NAME

OSSL_DEPRECATED, OSSL_DEPRECATED_FOR, OSSL_DEPRECATED_INSTEAD_USE - General deprecation macros

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/macros.h>

 #define OSSL_DEPRECATED(since)
 #define OSSL_DEPRECATED_FOR(since, msg)
 #define OSSL_DEPRECATED_INSTEAD_USE(f1, f2)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_DEPRECATED() implements the deprecated attribute if the compiler
supports it, otherwise it expands to nothing.  It takes one argument
I<since> that should be set to the OpenSSL version where the symbol was
deprecated, and will be displayed with the deprecation warning message,
for compilers that support user specified deprecation messages.

OSSL_DEPRECATED_FOR() does the same as OSSL_DEPRECATED(), but also takes a
second argument I<msg>, which is an additional text messages to be displayed
with the deprecation warning along with the OpenSSL version number, for
compilers that support user specified deprecation messages.

OSSL_DEPRECATED_INSTEAD_USE() implements a warning via a compiler specific
pragma, to be used when e.g. deprecating a macro.
It takes two arguments, I<f1> the function that is deprecated and I<f2>
the function that shall be used instead.

These macros are used to define the version specific deprecation macros
described in L<deprecation(7)>.
