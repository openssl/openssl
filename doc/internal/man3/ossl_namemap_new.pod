ossl_namemap_new, ossl_namemap_free, ossl_namemap_stored,
ossl_namemap_add, ossl_namemap_name, ossl_namemap_number
- internal number E<lt>-E<gt> name map

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include "internal/cryptlib.h"

 OSSL_NAMEMAP *ossl_namemap_stored(OPENSSL_CTX *libctx);

 OSSL_NAMEMAP *ossl_namemap_new(void);
 void ossl_namemap_free(OSSL_NAMEMAP *namemap);

 int ossl_namemap_add(OSSL_NAMEMAP *namemap, const char *name);
 const char *ossl_namemap_name(OSSL_NAMEMAP *namemap, int number);
 int ossl_namemap_number(OSSL_NAMEMAP *namemap, const char *name);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A B<OSSL_NAMEMAP> is a simple number E<lt>-E<gt> name map, which can
be used to give arbitrary any name (any string) a unique dynamic
identity that is valid throughout the lifetime of the associated
library context.

ossl_namemap_new() and ossl_namemap_free() construct and destruct a
new B<OSSL_NAMEMAP>.
This is suitable to use when the B<OSSL_NAMEMAP> is embedded in other
structures, or should be independent for any reason.

ossl_namemap_stored() finds or a auto-creates the default namemap in
the given library context.
The returned B<OSSL_NAMEMAP> can't be destructed using
ossl_namemap_free().

ossl_namemap_add() adds a new name to the namemap if it's not already
present.

ossl_namemap_name() finds the name corresponding to the given number.

ossl_namemap_number() finds the number corresponding to the given
name.

=head1 NOTES

It's possible that ossl_namemap_add(), ossl_namemap_name() and
ossl_namemap_number() will change to accept NULL as a B<OSSL_NAMEMAP>
to use one that is auto-created and associated with the default
library context.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_namemap_new() and ossl_namemap_stored() return the pointer to a
B<OSSL_NAMEMAP>, or NULL on error.

ossl_namemap_add() returns the number associated with the added
string, or zero on error.

ossl_namemap_name() returns a pointer to the name corresponding to the
given number, or NULL if it's undefined in the given B<OSSL_NAMEMAP>.

ossl_namemap_number() returns the number corresponding to the given
name, or 0 if it's undefined in the given B<OSSL_NAMEMAP>.
