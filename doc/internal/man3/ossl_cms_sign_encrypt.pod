=head1 NAME

ossl_cms_sign_encrypt
- Create CMS envelope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

 CMS_EnvelopedData *ossl_cms_sign_encrypt(BIO *data, X509 *sign_cert, STACK_OF(X509) *certs,
                                          EVP_PKEY *sign_key, unsigned int sign_flags,
                                          STACK_OF(X509) *enc_recip, const EVP_CIPHER *cipher,
                                          unsigned int enc_flags, OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx,
                                          const char *propq);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ossl_cms_sign_encrypt() creates a B<CMS_EnvelopedData> structure for recipients in
I<enc_recip>.

I<data> is signed using I<signcert> and I<signkey> to create B<CMS_SignedData> 
and then encrypted using I<enc_recip> to create B<CMS_EnvelopedData>.
The library context I<libctx> and the property query I<propq> are used
when retrieving algorithms from providers.

I<certs> is an optional additional set of certificates to include in the
B<CMS_SignedData> structure (e.g., any intermediate CAs in the chain of the signer certificate).

I<sign_flags> is an optional set of flags for the signing operation.
See L<CMS_sign_ex(3)> for more information.

I<enc_flags> is an optional set of flags for the encryption operation.
See L<CMS_encrypt_ex(3)> for more information.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, ossl_cms_sign_encrypt() return NULL and
set an error code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>. 
Otherwise, they return a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

=head1 HISTORY

ossl_cms_sign_encrypt() was added in OpenSSL 3.5.
