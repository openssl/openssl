=head1 NAME

rand_bytes_ex, rand_priv_bytes_ex
- internal random number routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include "internal/rand_int.h"

 int rand_bytes_ex(OPENSSL_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *buf, int num);
 int rand_priv_bytes_ex(OPENSSL_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *buf, int num);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rand_bytes_ex and rand_priv_bytes_ex are the equivalent of RAND_bytes() and
RAND_priv_bytes() in the public API except that they both take an additional
B<ctx> parameter.
The DRBG used for the operation is the public or private DRBG as appropriate
associated with the specified B<ctx>. The parameter can be NULL in which case
the default library ctx is used. If the default RAND_METHOD has been changed
then this overrides any library ctx and the RAND_METHOD implementation will be
used in preference.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

rand_bytes_ex and rand_bytes_priv_ex return 0 or less on error or 1 on success.
