=head1 NAME

ossl_cmp_msg_protect,
ossl_cmp_msg_add_extraCerts
- functions for producing CMP message protection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include "cmp_int.h"

  int ossl_cmp_msg_protect(OSSL_CMP_CTX *ctx, OSSL_CMP_MSG *msg);
  int ossl_cmp_msg_add_extraCerts(OSSL_CMP_CTX *ctx, OSSL_CMP_MSG *msg);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ossl_cmp_msg_protect() (re-)protects the given message B<msg> using an algorithm
depending on the available context information given in the B<ctx>.
If there is a secretValue it selects PBMAC, else if there is a protection cert
it selects Signature and uses B<ossl_cmp_msg_add_extraCerts()>.
It also sets the protectionAlg field in the message header accordingly.

ossl_cmp_msg_add_extraCerts() adds elements to the extraCerts field in the given
message B<msg>. It tries to build the certificate chain of the client cert in
the B<ctx> if present by using certificates in ctx->untrusted_certs;
if no untrusted certs are set, it will at least add the client certificate.
In any case all the certificates explicitly specified to be sent out (i.e.,
B<ctx->extraCertsOut>) are added. Note that it will NOT add the root certificate
of the chain, i.e, the trust anchor (unless it is part of extraCertsOut).

=head1 NOTES

CMP is defined in RFC 4210 (and CRMF in RFC 4211).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All functions return 1 on success, 0 on error.

=head1 HISTORY

The OpenSSL CMP support was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
