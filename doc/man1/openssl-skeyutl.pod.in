=head1 NAME

openssl-skeyutl - opaque symmetric keys routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<skeyutl>
[B<-help>]
[B<-cipher> I<cipher>]
[B<-skeymgmt> I<skeymgmt>]
[B<-skeyopt> I<opt>:I<value>]
[B<-genkey>]
{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_provider_synopsis -}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Not all cipher implementations support keys as raw bytes. E.g. PKCS#11 tokens
can store them internally without any option to get the raw byte representation.

This tool is designed for managing opaque symmetric keys.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-cipher> I<cipher>

The cipher to generate the key for.

=item B<-skeymgmt> I<skeymgmt>

Some providers may support opaque symmetric keys objects. To use them, we need
to know the I<skeymgmt>. If not specified, the name of the cipher will be used.

To find out the name of the suitable symmetric key management,
please refer to the output of the C<openssl list -skey-managers> command.

=item B<-skeyopt> I<opt>:I<value>

To obtain an existing opaque symmetric key or to generate a new one, key
options are specified as opt:value. These options can't be used together with
any options implying raw key either directly or indirectly.

=item B<-genkey>

Generate a new opaque key object.
