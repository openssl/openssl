=head1 NAME

openssl-configutl - openssl configuration file helper command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<configutl>
[B<-help>]
[B<-config> I<filename>]
[B<-out> I<filename>]
[B<-noheader>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Real world openssl configuration files with use of the B<.include> directive
are quite complex, and there is a need to see the resulting system-wide configuration.

This tool is designed for managing OpenSSL configuration files. Currently it
processes a configuration file with possibly complex structure and dumps an effective
resulting configuration file, to stdout by default.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-config> I<filename>

The configuration file to deal with. If omitted, the compiled one or the one defined
via the B<OPENSSL_CONF> environment variable is used.

=item B<-out> I<filename>

The output file to be used instead of stdout.

=item B<-noheader>

Don't print information about the original config file to be processed.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Dump the configuration file I<my.conf> processing all B<.include> directives to the
file B<result.conf>

 openssl configutl -config my.conf -out result.conf

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<config(5)>

=head1 HISTORY

The B<configutl> command was added in OpenSSL 3.6.
