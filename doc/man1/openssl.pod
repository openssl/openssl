I<command>
[ I<command_opts> ]
[ I<command_args> ]

B<openssl> B<list> [ B<standard-commands> | B<digest-commands> | B<cipher-commands> | B<cipher-algorithms> | B<digest-algorithms> | B<public-key-algorithms>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OpenSSL is a cryptography toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL
v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) network protocols and related
cryptography standards required by them.

The B<openssl> program is a command line tool for using the various
cryptography functions of OpenSSL's B<crypto> library from the shell.
It can be used for

 o  Creation and management of private keys, public keys and parameters
 o  Public key cryptographic operations
 o  Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
 o  Calculation of Message Digests
 o  Encryption and Decryption with Ciphers
 o  SSL/TLS Client and Server Tests
 o  Handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
 o  Time Stamp requests, generation and verification

=head1 COMMAND SUMMARY

The B<openssl> program provides a rich variety of commands (I<command> in the
SYNOPSIS above), each of which often has a wealth of options and arguments
(I<command_opts> and I<command_args> in the SYNOPSIS).

Many commands use an external configuration file for some or all of their
arguments and have a B<-config> option to specify that file.
The environment variable B<OPENSSL_CONF> can be used to specify
the location of the file.
If the environment variable is not specified, then the file is named
B<openssl.cnf> in the default certificate storage area, whose value
depends on the configuration flags specified when the OpenSSL
was built.

The list parameters B<standard-commands>, B<digest-commands>,
and B<cipher-commands> output a list (one entry per line) of the names
of all standard commands, message digest commands, or cipher commands,
respectively, that are available in the present B<openssl> utility.

The list parameters B<cipher-algorithms> and
B<digest-algorithms> list all cipher and message digest names, one entry per line. Aliases are listed as:

 from => to

The list parameter B<public-key-algorithms> lists all supported public
key algorithms.

The command B<no->I<XXX> tests whether a command of the
specified name is available.  If no command named I<XXX> exists, it
returns 0 (success) and prints B<no->I<XXX>; otherwise it returns 1
and prints I<XXX>.  In both cases, the output goes to B<stdout> and
nothing is printed to B<stderr>.  Additional command line arguments
are always ignored.  Since for each cipher there is a command of the
same name, this provides an easy way for shell scripts to test for the
availability of ciphers in the B<openssl> program.  (B<no->I<XXX> is
not able to detect pseudo-commands such as B<quit>,
B<list>, or B<no->I<XXX> itself.)

=head1 OPTIONS

Details of which options are available depend on the specific command.
This section describes some common options with common behavior.

=head2 Common Options

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Provides a terse summary of all options.

=back

=head2 Pass Phrase Options

Several commands accept password arguments, typically using B<-passin>
and B<-passout> for input and output passwords respectively. These allow
the password to be obtained from a variety of sources. Both of these
options take a single argument whose format is described below. If no
password argument is given and a password is required then the user is
prompted to enter one: this will typically be read from the current
terminal with echoing turned off.

Note that character encoding may be relevant, please see
L<passphrase-encoding(7)>.

=over 4

=item B<pass:password>

The actual password is B<password>. Since the password is visible
to utilities (like 'ps' under Unix) this form should only be used
where security is not important.

=item B<env:var>

Obtain the password from the environment variable B<var>. Since
the environment of other processes is visible on certain platforms
(e.g. ps under certain Unix OSes) this option should be used with caution.

=item B<file:pathname>

The first line of B<pathname> is the password. If the same B<pathname>
argument is supplied to B<-passin> and B<-passout> arguments then the first
line will be used for the input password and the next line for the output
password. B<pathname> need not refer to a regular file: it could for example
refer to a device or named pipe.

=item B<fd:number>

Read the password from the file descriptor B<number>. This can be used to
send the data via a pipe for example.

=item B<stdin>

Read the password from standard input.
