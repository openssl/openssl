=head1 NAME

openssl-ech - ECH key generation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<ech>
[B<-help>]
[B<-verbose>]
[B<-in> I<files>]
[B<-out> I<file>]
[B<-public_name> I<name>]
[B<-max_name_len> I<len>]
[B<-suite> I<suite_str>]
[B<-ech_version> I<version>]
[B<-select> I<number>]
[B<-text>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<openssl-ech(1)> command generates Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) key pairs
in the ECHConfig PEM file format as specified in
L<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-farrell-tls-pemesni/>.
TODO(ECH): update I-D reference to RFC when possible.

That format consists of an optional private key in PKCS#8 format and a base64
encoded ECHConfigList containing an entry with a matching public value (and
possibly other entries as well).

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options are supported:

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-verbose>

Print more verbosely.

=item B<-in>

Provide an input ECH PEM file for printing or merging. Up to five
input files can be provided via use of multiple B<in> arguments.

=item B<-out> I<file>

Name of output ECHConfig PEM file.  If a new key pair was generated the output
file will contain the private key and encoded ECHConfigList.  If one or more
input files was provided the output file will contain a set of ECHConfigList
values with public keys from the inputs, and no private key(s).

=item B<-text>

Provide human-readable text ouput.

=item B<-public_name> I<name>

The DNS name to use in the "public_name" field of the ECHConfig.

=item B<-max_name_len> I<num>

Maximum name length field value to use in the ECHConfig.

=item B<-suite> I<str>

HPKE suite to use in the ECHConfig.

=item B<-ech_version> I<version>

The ECH version to use in the ECHConfig. Only 0xfe0d is supported in this version.

=item B<-select> I<number>

Select the N-th ECHConfig/public key from the set of input ECH PEM files and output
that.

=head1 NOTES

Ciphersuites are specified using a comma-separated list of IANA-registered
codes/numbers e.g. "-c 0x20,1,3" or a comma-separated list of strings from:
- KEMs: p256, p384, p521, x25519, x448
- KDFs: hkdf-sha256, hkdf-sha384, hkdf-sha512
- AEADs: aes128gcm, aes256gcm, chachapoly1305

For example the default is: x25519, hkdf-sha256, aes128gcm
See L<OSSL_HPKE_CTX_new(3)> for details.
