=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command converts textual OpenSSL cipher lists into
ordered SSL cipher preference lists. It can be used to
determine the appropriate cipherlist.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print a usage message.

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_provider_item -}

=item B<-s>

Only list supported ciphers: those consistent with the security level, and
minimum and maximum protocol version.  This is closer to the actual cipher list
an application will support.

PSK and SRP ciphers are not enabled by default: they require B<-psk> or B<-srp>
to enable them.

It also does not change the default list of supported signature algorithms.

On a server the list of supported ciphers might also exclude other ciphers
depending on the configured certificates and presence of DH parameters.

If this option is not used then all ciphers that match the cipherlist will be
listed.

=item B<-psk>

When combined with B<-s> includes cipher suites which require PSK.

=item B<-srp>

When combined with B<-s> includes cipher suites which require SRP. This option
is deprecated.

=item B<-v>

Verbose output: For each cipher suite, list details as provided by
L<SSL_CIPHER_description(3)>.

=item B<-V>

Like B<-v>, but include the official cipher suite values in hex.

=item B<-tls1_3>, B<-tls1_2>, B<-tls1_1>, B<-tls1>, B<-ssl3>

In combination with the B<-s> option, list the ciphers which could be used if
the specified protocol were negotiated.
Note that not all protocols and flags may be available, depending on how
OpenSSL was built.

=item B<-stdname>

Precede each cipher suite by its standard name.

=item B<-convert> I<name>

Convert a standard cipher I<name> to its OpenSSL name.

=item B<-ciphersuites> I<val>

Sets the list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. This list will be combined with any
TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites that have been configured. The format for this
list is a simple colon (":") separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names. By
default this value is:

 TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

=item B<cipherlist>

A cipher list of TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites to convert to a cipher
preference list. This list will be combined with any TLSv1.3 ciphersuites that
have been configured. If it is not included then the default cipher list will be
used. The format is described below.

=back

=head1 CIPHER LIST FORMAT

The cipher list consists of one or more I<cipher strings> separated by colons.
Commas or spaces are also acceptable separators but colons are normally used.

The cipher string may reference a cipher using its standard name from
the IANA TLS Cipher Suites Registry
(L<https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-4>).

The actual cipher string can take several different forms.

It can consist of a single cipher suite such as B<AES256-SHA>.

It can represent a list of cipher suites containing a certain algorithm, or
cipher suites of a certain type. For example B<SHA256> represents all cipher
suites using the digest algorithm SHA256 and B<TLSv1.2> represents all
cipher suites introduced in TLS v.1.2.

Lists of cipher suites can be combined in a single cipher string using the
B<+> character. This is used as a logical B<and> operation. For example
B<SHA256+AES> represents all cipher suites using the SHA256 B<and> the AES
algorithms.

Each cipher string can be optionally preceded by the characters B<!>,
B<-> or B<+>.

If B<!> is used then the ciphers are permanently deleted from the list.
The ciphers deleted can never reappear in the list even if they are
explicitly stated.

If B<-> is used then the ciphers are deleted from the list, but some or
all of the ciphers can be added again by later options.

If B<+> is used then the ciphers are moved to the end of the list. This
option doesn't add any new ciphers it just moves matching existing ones.

If none of these characters is present then the string is just interpreted
as a list of ciphers to be appended to the current preference list. If the
list includes any ciphers already present they will be ignored: that is they
will not moved to the end of the list.

The cipher string B<@STRENGTH> can be used at any point to sort the current
cipher list in order of encryption algorithm key length.

The cipher string B<@SECLEVEL>=I<n> can be used at any point to set the security
level to I<n>, which should be a number between zero and five, inclusive.
See L<SSL_CTX_set_security_level(3)> for a description of what each level means.

The cipher list can be prefixed with the B<DEFAULT> keyword, which enables
the default cipher list as defined below.  Unlike cipher strings,
this prefix may not be combined with other strings using B<+> character.
For example, B<DEFAULT+AES> is not valid.

The content of the default list is determined at compile time and normally
corresponds to B<ALL:!COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT:!eNULL>.

=head1 CIPHER STRINGS

The following is a list of all permitted cipher strings and their meanings.

=over 4

=item B<COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT>

The cipher suites included in B<ALL>, but not enabled by default. The default
cipher suite list provides strong security and reasonable interoperability.
A cipher suite can be not included in the default list for different reasons:
because it is weak, or not "mature" enough, or not widely used, etc.
Note that this rule does not cover B<eNULL>, which is not included by B<ALL>
(use B<COMPLEMENTOFALL> if necessary).

=item B<ALL>

All cipher suites except the B<eNULL> ciphers (which must be explicitly enabled
if needed).
As of OpenSSL 1.0.0, the B<ALL> cipher suites are sensibly ordered by default.

=item B<COMPLEMENTOFALL>

The cipher suites not enabled by B<ALL>, currently B<eNULL>.

=item B<HIGH>

"High" encryption cipher suites. This currently means those with key lengths
larger than 128 bits, and some cipher suites with 128-bit keys.

=item B<MEDIUM>

"Medium" encryption cipher suites, currently some of those using 128 bit
encryption.

=item B<LOW>

"Low" encryption cipher suites, currently those using 64 or 56 bit
encryption algorithms but excluding export cipher suites.  All these
cipher suites have been removed as of OpenSSL 1.1.0.

=item B<FIPS>

Cipher suites permitted in FIPS mode.

=item B<eNULL>, B<NULL>

The "NULL" ciphers that is those offering no encryption. Because these offer no
encryption at all and are a security risk they are not enabled via either the
B<DEFAULT> or B<ALL> cipher strings.
Be careful when building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as
B<kRSA> or B<aECDSA> as these do overlap with the B<eNULL> ciphers.  When in
doubt, include B<!eNULL> in your cipherlist.

=item B<aNULL>

The cipher suites offering no authentication. This is currently the anonymous
DH algorithms and anonymous ECDH algorithms. These cipher suites are vulnerable
to "man in the middle" attacks and so their use is discouraged.
These are excluded from the B<DEFAULT> ciphers, but included in the B<ALL>
ciphers.
Be careful when building cipherlists out of lower-level primitives such as
B<kDHE> or B<AES> as these do overlap with the B<aNULL> ciphers.
When in doubt, include B<!aNULL> in your cipherlist.

=item B<kRSA>, B<aRSA>, B<RSA>

Cipher suites using RSA key exchange, RSA authentication, or both of them
respectively.

=item B<kDHE>, B<kEDH>, B<DH>

Cipher suites using ephemeral DH key agreement, including anonymous cipher
suites.

=item B<DHE>, B<EDH>

Cipher suites using authenticated ephemeral DH key agreement.

=item B<ADH>

Anonymous DH cipher suites, note that this does not include anonymous Elliptic
Curve DH (ECDH) cipher suites.

=item B<kEECDH>, B<kECDHE>, B<ECDH>

Cipher suites using ephemeral ECDH key agreement, including anonymous
cipher suites.

=item B<ECDHE>, B<EECDH>

Cipher suites using authenticated ephemeral ECDH key agreement.

=item B<AECDH>

=item B<aECDSA>, B<ECDSA>

Cipher suites using ECDSA authentication, i.e. the certificates carry ECDSA
keys.

=item B<TLSv1.2>, B<TLSv1.0>, B<SSLv3>

Lists cipher suites introduced in TLS v1.2, TLS v1.0 or SSL v3.0 respectively.
Note: there are no cipher suites specific to TLS v1.1.
Since this is only the minimum version, if, for example, TLSv1.0 is negotiated
then both TLSv1.0 and SSLv3.0 cipher suites are available.

Note: these cipher strings B<do not> change the negotiated version of SSL or
TLS, they only affect the list of available cipher suites.

=item B<AES128>, B<AES256>, B<AES>

cipher suites using 128 bit AES, 256 bit AES or either 128 or 256 bit AES.

=item B<AESGCM>

in TLS v1.2.

=item B<AESCCM>, B<AESCCM8>

AES in Cipher Block Chaining - Message Authentication Mode (CCM): these
cipher suites are only supported in TLS v1.2. B<AESCCM> references CCM
cipher suites using both 16 and 8 octet Integrity Check Value (ICV)
while B<AESCCM8> only references 8 octet ICV.

=item B<ARIA128>, B<ARIA256>

Cipher suites using 128 bit ARIA or 256 bit ARIA respectively.

=item B<ARIA>, B<ARIAGCM>

Cipher suites using either 128 or 256 bit ARIA.

=item B<CAMELLIA128>, B<CAMELLIA256>, B<CAMELLIA>

Cipher suites using 128 bit CAMELLIA, 256 bit CAMELLIA or either 128 or 256 bit
CAMELLIA.

=item B<CHACHA20>

Cipher suites using ChaCha20.

=item B<3DES>

Cipher suites using triple DES.

=item B<DES>

Cipher suites using DES (not triple DES).
All these cipher suites have been removed in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

=item B<SUITEB128>, B<SUITEB128ONLY>, B<SUITEB192>

Enables suite B mode of operation using 128 (permitting 192 bit mode by peer)
128 bit (not permitting 192 bit by peer) or 192 bit level of security
respectively.
If used these cipherstrings should appear first in the cipher
list and anything after them is ignored.
Setting Suite B mode has additional consequences required to comply with
RFC6460.
In particular the supported signature algorithms is reduced to support only
ECDSA and SHA256 or SHA384, only the elliptic curves P-256 and P-384 can be
used and only the two suite B compliant cipher suites
(ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 and ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384) are
permissible.

=item B<CBC>

All cipher suites using encryption algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
mode. These cipher suites are only supported in TLS v1.2 and earlier. Currently
it's an alias for the following cipherstrings: B<SSL_DES>, B<SSL_3DES>, B<SSL_RC2>,
B<SSL_IDEA>, B<SSL_AES128>, B<SSL_AES256>, B<SSL_CAMELLIA128>, B<SSL_CAMELLIA256>, B<SSL_SEED>.

=head1 CIPHER SUITE NAMES

The following lists give the standard SSL or TLS cipher suites names from the
relevant specification and their OpenSSL equivalents. You can use either
standard names or OpenSSL names in cipher lists, or a mix of both.

It should be noted, that several cipher suite names do not include the
authentication used, e.g. DES-CBC3-SHA. In these cases, RSA authentication
is used.

 EDH-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA - alias of DHE-DSS-DES-CBC3-SHA

=head1 NOTES

Some compiled versions of OpenSSL may not include all the ciphers
listed here because some ciphers were excluded at compile time.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Verbose listing of all OpenSSL ciphers including NULL ciphers:

 openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:eNULL'

Include all ciphers except NULL and anonymous DH then sort by
strength:

 openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!ADH:@STRENGTH'

Include all ciphers except ones with no encryption (eNULL) or no
authentication (aNULL):

 openssl ciphers -v 'ALL:!aNULL'

Include only AES ciphers and then place RSA ciphers last:

 openssl ciphers -v 'AES:+RSA'

Include all ciphers with RSA authentication but leave out ciphers without
encryption.

 openssl ciphers -v 'RSA:!COMPLEMENTOFALL'

Set security level to 2 and display all ciphers consistent with level 2:

 openssl ciphers -s -v 'ALL:@SECLEVEL=2'

=head1 HISTORY

The B<-V> option was added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.

The B<-stdname> is only available if OpenSSL is built with tracing enabled
(B<enable-ssl-trace> argument to Configure) before OpenSSL 1.1.1.

The B<-convert> option was added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.

Support for standard IANA names in cipher lists was added in
OpenSSL 3.2.0.
