=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_flush_sessions_ex, SSL_CTX_flush_sessions - remove expired sessions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 void SSL_CTX_flush_sessions_ex(SSL_CTX *ctx, time_t tm);

The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.4, and can be
hidden entirely by defining B<OPENSSL_API_COMPAT> with a suitable version value,
see L<openssl_user_macros(7)>:

 void SSL_CTX_flush_sessions(SSL_CTX *ctx, long tm);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_flush_sessions_ex() causes a run through the session cache of
B<ctx> to remove sessions expired at time B<tm>.

SSL_CTX_flush_sessions() is an older variant of the function that is not
Y2038 safe due to usage of long datatype instead of time_t.

=head1 NOTES

If enabled, the internal session cache will collect all sessions established
up to the specified maximum number (see SSL_CTX_sess_set_cache_size()).
As sessions will not be reused ones they are expired, they should be
removed from the cache to save resources. This can either be done
automatically whenever 255 new sessions were established (see
L<SSL_CTX_set_session_cache_mode(3)>)
or manually by calling SSL_CTX_flush_sessions_ex().

The parameter B<tm> specifies the time which should be used for the
expiration test, in most cases the actual time given by time(0)
will be used.

SSL_CTX_flush_sessions_ex() will only check sessions stored in the internal
cache. When a session is found and removed, the remove_session_cb is however
called to synchronize with the external cache (see
L<SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb(3)>).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_flush_sessions_ex() does not return a value.
