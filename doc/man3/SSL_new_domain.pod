=head1 NAME

SSL_new_domain,
SSL_is_domain,
SSL_get0_domain
- SSL object interface for managing QUIC event domains

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 SSL *SSL_new_domain(SSL_CTX *ctx, uint64_t flags);

 int SSL_is_domain(SSL *ssl);
 SSL *SSL_get0_domain(SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SSL_new_domain() function creates a new QUIC event domain, represented as an
SSL object. This is known as a QUIC domain SSL object (QDSO). The concept of a
QUIC event domain is discussed in detail in L<openssl-quic-concurrency(7)>.

The I<flags> argument to SSL_new_domain() accepts a set of domain flags. If the
I<flags> argument to SSL_new_domain() does not specify one of the flags
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD>, B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREAD> or
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_THREAD_ASSISTED>, the domain flags configured on the
B<SSL_CTX> are inherited as a default and any other flags in I<flags> are added
to the set of inherited flags. Otherwise, the domain flags in I<flags>
are used. See L<SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags(3)> for details of the available domain
flags and how they can be configured on a B<SSL_CTX>.

A QUIC domain SSL object can be managed in the same way as any other SSL object,
in that it can be refcounted and freed normally. A QUIC domain SSL object is the
parent of a number of child objects such as QUIC listener SSL objects. Once a
QUIC domain SSL object has been created, a listener can be created under it
using L<SSL_new_listener_from(3)>.

SSL_is_domain() returns 1 if a SSL object is a QUIC domain SSL object.

SSL_get0_domain() obtains a pointer to the QUIC domain SSL object in a SSL
object hierarchy (if any).

All SSL objects in a QUIC event domain use the same domain flags, and the domain
flags for a QUIC domain cannot be changed after construction.

=head2 Supported Operations

A QUIC domain SSL object exists to contain other QUIC SSL objects and provide
unified event handling. As such, it supports only the following operations:

=over 4

=item

Standard reference counting and free operations, such as L<SSL_up_ref(3)> and
L<SSL_free(3)>;

=item

Event processing and polling enablement APIs such as L<SSL_handle_events(3)>,
and L<SSL_get_event_timeout(3)>.

=item

Creating listeners under the domain using L<SSL_new_listener_from(3)>.

=back

The basic workflow of using a domain object is as follows:

=over 4

=item

Create a new domain object using SSL_new_domain() using a B<SSL_CTX> which uses
a supported B<SSL_METHOD> (such as L<OSSL_QUIC_server_method(3)>);

=item

Create listeners under the domain using L<SSL_new_listener_from(3)>.

=back

Refer to L<SSL_new_listener_from(3)> for details on using listeners.

Currently, domain SSL objects are only supported for QUIC usage via any QUIC
B<SSL_METHOD>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_new_domain() returns a new domain SSL object or NULL on failure.

SSL_is_domain() returns 0 or 1 depending on the type of the SSL object on
which it is called.

SSL_get0_domain() returns an SSL object pointer (potentially to the same object
on which it is called) or NULL.
