=head1 NAME

OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform
- client-side HTTP(S) transfer of a CMP request-response pair

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cmp.h>

 OSSL_CMP_MSG *OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform(OSSL_CMP_CTX *ctx,
                                         const OSSL_CMP_MSG *req);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform() sends the given PKIMessage I<req> to the
CMP server specified in I<ctx> and returns the result obtained from it.

If L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_transfer_cb_arg(3)> has been used to set the transfer
callback argument then the provided pointer I<bios> is taken as
a two-element B<BIO> array to use for the exchange with the server
as described for the I<bio> and I<rbio> parameters of L<OSSL_HTTP_open(3)>.
For instance, the two BIO pointers may be equal and refer to a TLS connection,
such as in BRSKI-AE where a pre-established TLS channel is reused for CMP.

Otherwise the server specified via L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_server(3)>
and optionally L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_serverPort(3)> is contacted,
where the default port is 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
The HTTP path (aka "CMP alias" in this context) to use is by default C</>,
otherwise the string specified via L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_serverPath(3)>.
On success the function returns the server's response PKIMessage.

The function makes use of any HTTP callback function
set via L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_http_cb(3)>.
It respects any timeout value set via L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_option(3)>
with an B<OSSL_CMP_OPT_MSG_TIMEOUT> argument.
It also respects any HTTP(S) proxy options set via L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_proxy(3)>
and L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set1_no_proxy(3)> and the respective environment variables.
Proxying plain HTTP is supported directly,
while using a proxy for HTTPS connections requires a suitable callback function
such as L<OSSL_HTTP_proxy_connect(3)>.

=head1 NOTES

CMP is defined in RFC 4210.
HTTP transfer for CMP is defined in RFC 6712.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform()
returns the received CMP response message on success, else NULL.

=head1 HISTORY

The OpenSSL CMP support was added in OpenSSL 3.0.

The OSSL_CMP_MSG_http_perform() use of transfer_cb_arg was added in OpenSSL 3.5.
