=head1 NAME

BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor, BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor - obtain a structure which
can be used to determine when a BIO object can next be read or written

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/bio.h>

 typedef struct bio_poll_descriptor_st {
     uint32_t type;
     union {
         int        fd;
         void       *custom;
         uintptr_t  custom_ui;
     } value;
 } BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR;

 int BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor(BIO *b, BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR *desc);
 int BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor(BIO *b, BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR *desc);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor() and BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor(), on success, fill
I<*desc> with a poll descriptor. A poll descriptor is a tagged union structure
which represents some kind of OS or non-OS resource which can be used to
synchronise on I/O availability events.

BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor() outputs a descriptor which can be used to determine
when the BIO can (potentially) next be read, and BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()
outputs a descriptor which can be used to determine when the BIO can
(potentially) next be written.

It is permissible for BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor() and BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor()
to output the same descriptor.

Poll descriptors can represent different kinds of information. A typical kind of
resource which might be represented by a poll descriptor is an OS file
descriptor which can be used with APIs such as select().

The kinds of poll descriptor defined by OpenSSL are:

=over 4

=item BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE

Represents the absence of a valid poll descriptor. It may be used by
BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor() or BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor() to indicate that the
BIO is not pollable for readability or writeability respectively.

For this type, no field within the I<value> field of the B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR>
is valid.

=item BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SOCK_FD

The poll descriptor represents an OS socket resource. The field I<value.fd>
in the B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR> is valid if it is not set to -1.

The resource is whatever kind of handle is used by a given OS to represent
sockets, which may vary by OS. For example, on Windows, the value is a B<SOCKET>
for use with the Winsock API. On POSIX-like platforms, it is a file descriptor.

Where a poll descriptor of this type is output by BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor(), it
should be polled for readability to determine when the BIO might next be able to
successfully complete a BIO_read() operation; likewise, where a poll descriptor
of this type is output by BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor(), it should be polled for
writeability to determine when the BIO might next be able to successfully
complete a BIO_write() operation.

=item BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_CUSTOM_START

Type values beginning with this value (inclusive) are reserved for application
allocation for custom poll descriptor types. Any of the definitions in the union
field I<value> can be used by the application arbitrarily as opaque values.

=back

Because poll descriptors are a tagged union structure, they can represent
different kinds of information. New types of poll descriptor may be defined,
including by applications, according to their needs.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The functions BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor() and BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor() return 1
on success and 0 on failure.

These functions are permitted to succeed and initialise I<*desc> with a poll
descriptor of type B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE> to indicate that the BIO is
not pollable for readability or writeability respectively.

=head1 HISTORY

The BIO_get_rpoll_descriptor() and BIO_get_wpoll_descriptor() functions were
added in OpenSSL 3.2.
