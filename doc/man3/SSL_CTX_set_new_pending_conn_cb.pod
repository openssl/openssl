=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_new_pending_conn_cb, SSL_set_new_pending_conn_cb_fn - callback function to report creation of QUIC connection SSL objects 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 typedef int (*SSL_set_new_pending_conn_cb_fn)(SSL_CTX *c, SSL *new_ssl,
                                               void *arg);
 void SSL_CTX_set_new_pending_conn_cb(SSL_CTX *c,
                                     SSL_set_new_pending_conn_cb_fn *f,
                                     void *arg);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_new_pending_conn_cb() sets the new_pending_conn callback function and
associated application data argument I<arg>.  When using the QUIC transport, TLS
handshake processing may occur independently from the thread which accepts the
connection that the handshake is establishing.  As such, B<SSL> objects
representing the connection may be allocated and initialized prior to a call to
SSL_accept_connection().  This registered callback may be used to decorate the 
preallocated B<SSL> object or create other associations with its parent
B<SSL> prior to a call to SSL_accept_connection().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_new_pending_conn_cb() returns no value.

SSL_set_new_pending_conn_cb_fn() returns an integer value.  A return value of
0 indicates that the QUIC stack must discard this newly created B<SSL> object,
implying that the associated new connection will not be available for handling
on a subsequent call to SSL_accept_connection().  A nonzero return
value is treated as success, allowing the new connection to be enqueued to the
accept queue.

=head1 NOTES

Callbacks in QUIC connections have some limitations to them that should be taken
into consideration when writing an application.

=over 4

QUIC connections may begin processing prior to when an application calls
SSL_accept_connection() on them.  As such, it may occur that callbacks are
delivered to appliations' registered TLS callbacks prior to those SSL objects
being returned in SSL_accept_connection().  Applications should expect this
possibilty

In Particular no references should be held on SSL objects passed to callbacks
for QUIC connections until such time as they are returned through a call to
SSL_accept_connection.
