=head1 NAME

SSL_get1_builtin_sigalgs - get list of built-in signature algorithms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/tls1.h>

 char *SSL_get1_builtin_sigalgs(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Return the colon-separated list of built-in and available TLS signature
algorithms.
The string returned must be freed by the user using L<OPENSSL_free(3)>.

=head1 NOTES

The string may be empty (strlen==0) if none of the built-in TLS signature
algorithms can be activated, e.g., if suitable providers are missing.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

NULL may be returned if no memory could be allocated. Otherwise, a
newly allocated string is always returned but it may have strlen == 0.

=head1 HISTORY

This function was added in OpenSSL 3.4.
