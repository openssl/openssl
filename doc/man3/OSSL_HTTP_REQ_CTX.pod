=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX> is a context structure for an HTTP request, used to
collect all the necessary data to perform that request.

This file documents low-level HTTP functions rarely used directly.  High-level
HTTP client functions like L<OSSL_HTTP_get(3)> and L<OSSL_HTTP_transfer(3)>
should be preferred.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new() allocates a new HTTP request context structure, which
gets populated with the B<BIO> to send the request to (I<wbio>), the B<BIO> to
read the response from (I<rbio>, which may be the same as I<wbio>), the
request method (I<method_GET>, which may be 1 to indicate that the C<GET>
method is to be used, or 0 to indicate that the C<POST> method is to be used),
the maximum expected response header length (I<max_resp_len>, where any zero
or less indicates the default of 4KiB), a response timeout measure in seconds
(I<timeout>, where 0 indicates no timeout, i.e., waiting indefinitely), the
expected MIME content type of the response (I<expected_content_type>, which
may be NULL for no expectation), and a flag indicating that the response is
expected to be a DER encoded ASN.1 structure (I<expect_asn1>).
The allocated context structure is also populated with an internal allocated
memory B<BIO>, which collects the HTTP request and additional headers as text.
The returned context should only be used for a single HTTP request/response.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_free() frees up the HTTP request context I<rctx>.
The I<wbio> and I<rbio> are not free'd and it is up to the application
to do so.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_header() adds an HTTP request line to the request context.
The request command itself becomes C<GET> or C<POST> depending on the value
of I<method_GET> in the OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new() call.  I<server> and I<port>
may be set to indicate a proxy server and port that the request should go
through, otherwise they should be left NULL.  I<path> is the HTTP request path;
if left NULL, C</> is used.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_add1_header() adds header I<name> with value I<value> to the
context I<rctx>. It can be called more than once to add multiple headers.
For example, to add a C<Host> header for C<example.com> you would call:

 OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_add1_header(ctx, "Host", "example.com");

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_i2d() finalizes the HTTP request context by adding the DER
encoding of I<req>, using the ASN.1 template I<it> to do the encoding.  The
HTTP header C<Content-Length> is automatically filled out, and if
I<content_type> isn't NULL, the HTTP header C<Content-Type> is also added with
its content as value.  All of this ends up in the internal memory B<BIO>.
This requires that the request type be C<POST>, i.e. that I<method_GET> is 0
in the OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new() call.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_nbio() attempts the exchange of request and response via HTTP,
using the I<rbio> and I<wbio> that were given in the OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new()
call.  When successful, the contents of the internal memory B<BIO> is replaced
with the contents of the HTTP response, without the response headers.
It may need to be called again if its result is -1, which indicates
L<BIO_should_retry(3)>.  In such a case it is advisable to sleep a little in
between to prevent a busy loop.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_sendreq_d2i() calls OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_nbio(), possibly
several times until a timeout is reached, and DER decodes the received
response using the ASN.1 template I<it>.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_set_max_response_length() sets the maximum response length
for I<rctx> to I<len>. If the response exceeds this length an error occurs.
If not set a default value of 100k is used.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_get0_mem_bio() returns the internal memory B<BIO>.  This can
be used to affect the HTTP request text.  I<Use with caution!>

=head1 WARNINGS

The server's response may be unexpected if the hostname that was used to
create the I<wbio>, any C<Host> header, and the host specified in the
request URL do not match.

Many of these functions must be called in a certain order.

First, the HTTP request context must be allocated:
OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new().

Then, the HTTP request must be prepared with request data:

=over 4

=item 1.

Calling OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_header().  This must be done exactly once.

=item 2.

Adding extra headers with OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_add1_header().  This is optional.

=item 3.

Add C<POST> data with OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_i2d().  This may only be done if
I<method_GET> was 0 in the OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new() call, and must be done
exactly once in that case.

=back

When the request context is fully prepared, the HTTP exchange may be performed
with OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_nbio() or OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_sendreq_d2i().

Furthermore, all calls of OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_header() and
OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_add1_header() must be done before any call to
int OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_nbio() or OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_sendreq_d2i().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_new() returns a pointer to a B<OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX>, or NULL
on error.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_free() and OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_set_max_response_length()
do not return values.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_header(), OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_add1_header(),
OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_i2d() and OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_nbio return 1 for success and 0
for failure.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_sendreq_d2i() returns a pointer to an B<ASN1_VALUE> for
success and NULL for failure.

OSSL_HTTP_REQ_CTX_get0_mem_bio() returns the internal memory B<BIO>.
