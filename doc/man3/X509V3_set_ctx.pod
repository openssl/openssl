=head1 NAME

X509V3_set_ctx,
X509V3_set_issuer_pkey - X.509 v3 extension generation utilities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509v3.h>

 void X509V3_set_ctx(X509V3_CTX *ctx, X509 *issuer, X509 *subject,
                     X509_REQ *req, X509_CRL *crl, int flags);
 int X509V3_set_issuer_pkey(X509V3_CTX *ctx, EVP_PKEY *pkey);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509V3_set_ctx() fills in the basic fields of I<ctx> of type B<X509V3_CTX>,
providing details potentially needed by functions producing X509 v3 extensions.
These may make use of fields of the certificate I<subject>, the certification
request I<req>, or the certificate revocation list I<crl>.
At most one of these three parameters can be non-NULL.
When constructing the subject key identifier of a certificate by computing a
hash value of its public key, the public key is taken from I<subject> or I<req>.
Similarly, when constructing subject alternative names from any email addresses
contained in a subject DN, the subject DN is taken from I<subject> or I<req>.
If I<subject> or I<crl> is provided, I<issuer> should point to its issuer, for
instance as a reference for generating the authority key identifier extension.
I<issuer> may be the same pointer value as I<subject> (which usually is an
indication that the I<subject> certificate is self-issued or even self-signed).
In this case the fallback source for generating the authority key identifier
extension will be taken from any value provided using X509V3_set_issuer_pkey().
I<flags> may be 0
or contain B<X509V3_CTX_TEST>, which means that just the syntax of
extension definitions is to be checked without actually producing any extension,
or B<X509V3_CTX_REPLACE>, which means that each X.509v3 extension added as
defined in some configuration section shall replace any already existing
extension with the same OID.

X509V3_set_issuer_pkey() explicitly sets the issuer private key of
the subject certificate that has been provided in I<ctx>.
This should be done in case the I<issuer> and I<subject> arguments to
X509V3_set_ctx() have the same pointer value
to provide fallback data for the authority key identifier extension.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509V3_set_issuer_pkey() returns 1 on success and 0 on error.
