=head1 NAME

SSL_get_peer_addr - obtain the peer address of a QUIC connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_get_peer_addr(SSL *ssl, BIO_ADDR *peer_addr);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_peer_addr() retrieves the peer address of a QUIC connection and stores
it into the B<BIO_ADDR> structure pointed to by I<peer_addr>. The caller must
supply a valid B<BIO_ADDR> object which will be filled in on success.

This function is only meaningful when called on an SSL object which represents
a QUIC connection or stream. It is not valid for non-QUIC SSL objects.

=head1 NOTES

The peer address identifies the remote endpoint of a QUIC connection. For UDP
sockets used by QUIC, the kernel does not maintain a connected peer in the same
sense as for TCP. Instead, the peer address is tracked in the QUIC connection
state. SSL_get_peer_addr() provides a way to obtain this address information
from OpenSSL.

The B<BIO_ADDR> type is an OpenSSL abstraction which can represent
both IPv4 and IPv6 socket addresses. Applications can get the address
family via the L<BIO_ADDR(3)> API.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_get_peer_addr() returns 1 on success. On failure, or if called on an SSL
object which is not a QUIC SSL object, 0 is returned and I<peer_addr> is left
unchanged.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<SSL_accept_connection(3)>, L<SSL_accept_stream(3)>, L<BIO_ADDR(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

This function was added in OpenSSL 4.0.
