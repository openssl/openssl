=head1 NAME

SSL_inject_net_dgram - inject a datagram as though received from the network

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_inject_net_dgram(SSL *s, const unsigned char *buf,
                          size_t buf_len,
                          const BIO_ADDR *peer,
                          const BIO_ADDR *local);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function can be used to inject a datagram payload to a QUIC connection SSL
object. The payload is processed as though it was received from the network.
This function can be used for debugging purposes or to allow datagrams to be fed
to QUIC from alternative sources.

I<buf> is required and must point to a datagram payload to inject. I<buf_len> is
the length of the buffer in bytes. The buffer is copied and need not remain
valid after this function returns.

I<peer> and I<local> are optional values pointing to B<BIO_ADDR> structures
describing the remote and local UDP endpoint addresses for the packet. Though
the injected packet was not actually received from the network directly by
OpenSSL, the packet will be processed as though the received datagram had the
given addresses.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Returns 1 on success or 0 on failure. This function always fails if called
on an SSL object which is not a QUIC connection SSL object.

=head1 HISTORY

The function SSL_inject_net_dgram() was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
