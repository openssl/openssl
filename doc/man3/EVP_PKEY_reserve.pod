=head1 NAME

EVP_PKEY_reserve - Extracts a key from an existing key

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 EVP_PKEY *EVP_PKEY_reserve(EVP_PKEY *pkey, const OSSL_PARAM *params);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_PKEY_reserve() is used to divide a key into 2 parts. The newly returned key
is a portion of the passed in key. The passed in key |pkey| may mutate, so this
is not the same as EVP_PKEY_dup().
Optional |params| can be passed in that are specific to the key type that
we wish to split. This functionality is not supported by all key types.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_PKEY_reserve() returns the newly created key on success, or NULL on failure.


=head1 HISTORY

the function EVP_PKEY_reserve() was added in OpenSSL 3.5.0
