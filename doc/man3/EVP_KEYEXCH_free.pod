=head1 NAME

EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch, EVP_KEYEXCH_free, EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref, EVP_KEYEXCH_provider
- Functions to manage EVP_KEYEXCH algorithm objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 EVP_KEYEXCH *EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch(OPENSSL_CTX *ctx, const char *algorithm,
                                const char *properties);
 void EVP_KEYEXCH_free(EVP_KEYEXCH *exchange);
 int EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref(EVP_KEYEXCH *exchange);
 OSSL_PROVIDER *EVP_KEYEXCH_provider(const EVP_KEYEXCH *exchange);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch() fetches the key exchange implementation for the given
I<algorithm> from any provider offering it, within the criteria given
by the I<properties>.
See L<provider(7)/Fetching algorithms> for further information.

The returned value must eventually be freed with EVP_KEYEXCH_free().

EVP_KEYEXCH_free() decrements the reference count for the B<EVP_KEYEXCH>
structure. Typically this structure will have been obtained from an earlier call
to EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch(). If the reference count drops to 0 then the
structure is freed.

EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref() increments the reference count for an B<EVP_KEYEXCH>
structure.

EVP_KEYEXCH_provider() returns the provider that I<exchange> was fetched from.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_KEYEXCH_fetch() returns a pointer to a B<EVP_KEYEXCH> for success
or NULL for failure.

EVP_KEYEXCH_up_ref() returns 1 for success or 0 otherwise.
