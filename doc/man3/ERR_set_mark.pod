=head1 NAME

ERR_set_mark, ERR_clear_last_mark, ERR_pop_to_mark, ERR_count_to_mark, ERR_pop -
set mark, clear mark, pop errors until mark and pop last error

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/err.h>

 int ERR_set_mark(void);
 int ERR_pop_to_mark(void);
 int ERR_clear_last_mark(void);
 int ERR_count_to_mark(void);
 int ERR_pop(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ERR_set_mark() sets a mark on the current topmost error record if there
is one.

ERR_pop_to_mark() will pop the top of the error stack until a mark is found.
The mark is then removed.  If there is no mark, the whole stack is removed.

ERR_clear_last_mark() removes the last mark added if there is one.

ERR_count_to_mark() returns the number of entries on the error stack above the
most recently marked entry, not including that entry. If there is no mark in the
error stack, the number of entries in the error stack is returned.

ERR_pop() unconditionally pops a single error entry from the top of the error
stack (which is the entry obtainable via L<ERR_peek_last_error(3)>).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ERR_set_mark() returns 0 if the error stack is empty, otherwise 1.

ERR_clear_last_mark() and ERR_pop_to_mark() return 0 if there was no mark in the
error stack, which implies that the stack became empty, otherwise 1.

ERR_count_to_mark() returns the number of error stack entries found above the
most recent mark, if any, or the total number of error stack entries.

ERR_pop() returns 1 if an error was popped or 0 if the error stack was empty.

=head1 HISTORY

ERR_count_to_mark() was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
ERR_pop() was added in OpenSSL 3.3.
