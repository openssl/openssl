=head1 DESCRIPTION

The logging and error reporting facility described here contains
convenience functions for CMP-specific logging via the trace API,
including a string prefix mirroring the severity levels of syslog.h,
and enhancements of the error queue mechanism needed for large diagnostic
messages produced by the CMP library in case of certificate validation failures.

When an interesting activity is performed or an error occurs, some detail
should be provided for user information, debugging, and auditing purposes.
A CMP application can obtain this information by providing a callback function
with the following type:

 typedef void (*OSSL_cmp_log_cb_t)(const char *component,
                                   const char *file, int line,
                                   OSSL_CMP_severity level, const char *msg);

The parameters may provide
a component identifier (which may be a library name or function name) or NULL,
a file pathname or NULL,
a line number or 0 indicating the source code location,
a severity level, and
a message string describing the nature of the event, terminated by '\n'.

Even when an activity is successful some warnings may be useful and some degree
of auditing may be required. Therefore the logging facility supports a severity
level and the callback function has a B<level> parameter indicating such a
level, such that error, warning, info, debug, etc. can be treated differently.
The callback is activated only when the severity level is sufficient according
to the current level of verbosity, which by default is OSSL_CMP_LOG_INFO.

The callback function may itself do non-trivial tasks like writing to
a log file or remote stream, which in turn may fail.
Therefore the function should return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

OSSL_CMP_log_open() initializes the CMP-specific logging facility to output
everything to STDOUT. It fails if the integrated tracing is disabled or STDIO
is not available. It may be called during application startup.
Alternatively, L<OSSL_CMP_CTX_set_log_cb(3)> can be used for more flexibility.
As long as neither if the two is used any logging output is ignored.

OSSL_CMP_log_close() may be called when all activities are finished to flush
any pending CMP-specific log output and deallocate related resources.
It may be called multiple times. It does get called at OpenSSL stutdown.

OSSL_CMP_alert() outputs a simple alert message via the trace API.
OSSL_CMP_err() outputs a simple error message via the trace API.
OSSL_CMP_warn() outputs a simple warning message via the trace API.
OSSL_CMP_info() outputs a simple info message via the trace API.
OSSL_CMP_debug() outputs a simple debug message via the trace API.

Note that due to the design of the trace API used, the log functions have no
effect unless the B<enable-trace> option is used during build configuration.

OSSL_CMP_print_errors_cb() outputs any entries in the OpenSSL error queue.
It is similar to B<ERR_print_errors_cb()> but uses the CMP log callback function
C<log_fn> for uniformity with CMP logging if not B<NULL>. Otherwise it uses
B<ERR_print_errors(3)> to print to STDERR (unless OPENSSL_NO_STDIO is defined).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_CMP_log_close() and OSSL_CMP_print_errors_cb() do not return anything.

All other functions return 1 on success, 0 on error.

=head1 HISTORY

The OpenSSL CMP support was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
