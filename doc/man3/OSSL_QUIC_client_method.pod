=head1 NAME

OSSL_QUIC_client_method, OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method, OSSL_QUIC_server_method
- Provide SSL_METHOD objects for QUIC enabled functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/quic.h>

 const SSL_METHOD *OSSL_QUIC_client_method(void);
 const SSL_METHOD *OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method(void);
 const SSL_METHOD *OSSL_QUIC_server_method(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OSSL_QUIC_client_method(), OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method(), and
OSSL_QUIC_server_method() functions provide methods for the
L<SSL_CTX_new_ex(3)> function to provide QUIC protocol support.

The OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method() uses threads to allow for a blocking
mode of operation and avoid the need to return control to the
OpenSSL library for processing time based events.
The OSSL_QUIC_client_method() does not use threads and depends on
nonblocking mode of operation and the application periodically calling SSL
functions.

The OSSL_QUIC_server_method() provides server-side QUIC protocol support and
must be used using the L<SSL_new_listener(3)> API. Attempting to use
OSSL_QUIC_server_method() with L<SSL_new(3)> will result in an error.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return pointers to the constant method objects.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<SSL_CTX_new_ex(3)>, L<SSL_new_listener(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

OSSL_QUIC_client_method() and OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method() were added in
OpenSSL 3.2.

OSSL_QUIC_server_method() was added in OpenSSL @VERSION_QUIC_SERVER@.
