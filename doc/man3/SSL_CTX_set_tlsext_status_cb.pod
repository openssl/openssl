=head1 DESCRIPTION

A client application may request that a server send back OCSP status response(s)
(also known as OCSP stapling). To do so the client should call the
SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_type() function prior to the creation of any SSL
objects. Alternatively an application can call the SSL_set_tlsext_status_type()
function on an individual SSL object prior to the start of the handshake.
Currently the only supported type is B<TLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocsp>. This value
should be passed in the B<type> argument. Calling
SSL_CTX_get_tlsext_status_type() will return the type B<TLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocsp>
previously set via SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_type() or -1 if not set.

For TLS versions before 1.3 only a single OCSP status response is sent back
by the server. TLS 1.3 specifies that the server can send OCSP status responses
for the whole chain (OCSP multi-stapling).

The client should additionally provide a callback function to decide what to do
with the returned OCSP response by calling SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb(). The
callback function should determine whether the returned OCSP response(s) are
acceptable or not. The callback will be passed as an argument the value
previously set via a call to SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_arg(). Note that the
callback will not be called in the event of a handshake where session resumption
occurs (because there are no Certificates exchanged in such a handshake).
The callback previously set via SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb() can be retrieved
by calling SSL_CTX_get_tlsext_status_cb(), and the argument by calling
SSL_CTX_get_tlsext_status_arg().

On the client side SSL_get_tlsext_status_type() can be used to determine whether
the client has previously called SSL_set_tlsext_status_type(). It will return
B<TLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocsp> if it has been called or -1 otherwise. On the server
side SSL_get_tlsext_status_type() can be used to determine whether the client
requested OCSP stapling. If the client requested it then this function will
return B<TLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocsp>, or -1 otherwise.

A single response returned by the server (TLS < 1.3) can be obtained via a call
to SSL_get_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp(). The value B<*resp> will be updated to
point to the OCSP response data and the return value will be the length of that
data. Typically a callback would obtain an OCSP_RESPONSE object from this data
via a call to the d2i_OCSP_RESPONSE() function. If the server has not provided
any response data then B<*resp> will be NULL and the return value from
SSL_get_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp() will be -1.

A server application must also call the SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb() function
if it wants to be able to provide clients with (single) OCSP response for the
server certificate. Typically the server callback would obtain the server
certificate that is being sent back to the client via a call to
SSL_get_certificate(); retrieve the related OCSP response to be sent back; and
then set that response data by calling SSL_set_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp(). A
pointer to the response data should be provided in the B<resp> argument, and
the length of that data should be in the B<len> argument.

In the case of multi-stapling the responses to be returned by the server can be
obtained via a call to SSL_get0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex(). The value B<*resp>
will be updated to point to the OCSP response stack and the return value will
be the number of responses on the stack.
The OCSP responses on the stack are expected to be in the same order as the
certificates in the chain. If no OCSP response is available for a certificate
in the chain, a NULL element in the stack will represent this.
Typically a callback would obtain an OCSP_RESPONSE object from the stack via a
call to sk_OCSP_RESPONSE_pop. If the server has not provided any response data
then B<*resp> will be NULL and the return value from
SSL_get0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex() will be -1.

A server application must also call the SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb() function
if it wants to be able to provide clients with OCSP Certificate Status
responses, where TLS 1.3 allows for multi-stapling, i.e., providing responses
for all certificates in the chain of the server certificate (excluding the root
CA certificate).
The certificates sent back to the client and for which OCSP response(s)
should be acquired could be obtained via call to SSL_get_certificate() resp.
SSL_get0_chain_certs(). OCSP response(s) then set by calling
SSL_set0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex(). A stack of OCSP responses should be
provided in the B<resp> argument.
The OCSP responses on the stack are expected to be in the same order as the
certificate in the chain. If no OCSP response is available for a certificate in
the chain, a NULL element in the stack will represent this.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The callback when used on the client side should return a negative value on
error; 0 if the response is not acceptable (in which case the handshake will
fail) or a positive value if it is acceptable.

The callback when used on the server side should return with either
SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_OK (meaning that the OCSP response that has been set should be
returned), SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK (meaning that an OCSP response should not be
returned) or SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_ALERT_FATAL (meaning that a fatal error has
occurred).

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_cb(), SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_arg(),
SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_type(), SSL_set_tlsext_status_type(),
SSL_set_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp() return 0 on error or 1 on success.
SSL_set0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex() will return always 1.

SSL_CTX_get_tlsext_status_type() returns the value previously set by
SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_type(), or -1 if not set.

SSL_get_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp() returns the length of the OCSP response data
or -1 if there is no OCSP response data.

SSL_get0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex() returns the number of the OCSP responses
on the stack or -1 if there is no OCSP response data.

SSL_get_tlsext_status_type() returns B<TLSEXT_STATUSTYPE_ocsp> on the client
side if SSL_set_tlsext_status_type() was previously called, or on the server
side if the client requested OCSP stapling. Otherwise -1 is returned.

=head1 HISTORY

The SSL_get_tlsext_status_type(), SSL_CTX_get_tlsext_status_type()
and SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_status_type() functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

The SSL_get0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex() and SSL_set0_tlsext_status_ocsp_resp_ex()
macros were added in OpenSSL 3.6.
