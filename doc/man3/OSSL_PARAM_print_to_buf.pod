=head1 NAME

OSSL_PARAM_print_to_buf
- OSSL_PARAM interrogation utilities 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/params.h>

 int OSSL_PARAM_print_to_buf(const OSSL_PARAM *p, char **buf,
                             int print_values);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_PARAM_print_to_buf() formats each parameter contained in the
passed in array of OSSL_PARAM values B<p>, and prints both the key,
and optionally its value, to an in memory buffer, returning that buffer
to the caller.  B<p> must be a non-null array of OSSL_PARAM values, terminated
with a value containing a null B<key> member.  B<buf> is a pointer to a
character array.  B<*buf> is automatically sized an allocated by this routine,
and on succesful return, must be freed by the caller. B<print_values> is a
control parameter, indicating that key values should be printed, in addition to
key names.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_PARAM_print_to_buf() returns the length of B<*buf> on success, and -1
if any error has occured.
