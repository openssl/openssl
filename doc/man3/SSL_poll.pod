=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_poll() allows the readiness conditions of the resources represented by one
or more BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR structures to be determined. In particular, it can
be used to query for readiness conditions on QUIC connection SSL objects and
QUIC stream SSL objects in a single call.

A call to SSL_poll() specifies an array of B<SSL_POLL_ITEM> structures, each of
which designates a resource which is being polled for readiness, and a set of
event flags which indicate the specific readiness events which the caller is
interested in in relation to the specified resource.

The fields of B<SSL_POLL_ITEM> are as follows:

=over 4

=item I<desc>

The resource being polled for readiness, as represented by a
B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR>. Currently, this must be a poll descriptor of type
B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SSL>, representing an SSL object pointer, and the SSL
object must be a QUIC connection SSL object or QUIC stream SSL object.

If a B<SSL_POLL_ITEM> has a poll descriptor type of
B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE>, or the SSL object pointer is NULL, the
B<SSL_POLL_ITEM> array entry is ignored and I<revents> will be set to 0 on
return.

=item I<events>

This is the set of zero or more events which the caller is interested in
learning about in relation to the resource described by I<desc>. It is a
collection of zero or more B<SSL_POLL_EVENT> flags. See L</EVENT TYPES> for a
description of each of the event types.

=item I<revents>

After SSL_poll() returns, this is the set of zero or more events which are
actually applicable to the resource described by I<desc>. As for I<events>,
it is a collection of zero or more B<SSL_POLL_EVENT> flags.

I<revents> need not be a subset of the events specified in I<events>, as some
event types are defined as always being enabled (non-maskable). See L</EVENT
TYPES> for more information.

=back

To use SSL_poll(), call it with an array of B<SSL_POLL_ITEM> structures. The
array need remain allocated only for the duration of the call. I<num_items> must
be set to the number of entries in the array, and I<stride> must be set to
C<sizeof(SSL_POLL_ITEM)>.

The present implementation of SSL_poll() is a subset of the functionality which
will eventually be available. Only a nonblocking mode of operation is available
at this time, where SSL_poll() always returns immediately. As such, I<timeout>
must point to a valid B<struct timeval> and that structure must be set to zero.
In future, other inputs to the I<timeout> argument will result in a blocking
mode of operation, which is not currently supported. For more information, see
L</LIMITATIONS>.

The following flags are currently defined for the I<flags> argument:

=over 4

=item B<SSL_POLL_FLAG_NO_HANDLE_EVENTS>

This flag indicates that internal state machine processing should not be
performed in an attempt to generate new readiness events. Only existing
readiness events will be reported.

=back

The I<result_count> argument is optional. If it is non-NULL, it is used to
output the number of entries in the array which have nonzero I<revents> fields
when the call to SSL_poll() returns; see L</RETURN VALUES> for details.

=head1 EVENT TYPES

The SSL_poll() interface reports zero or more event types on a given resource,
represented by a bit mask.

All of the event types are level triggered and represent a readiness or
permanent exception condition; as such, after an event has been reported by
SSL_poll() for a resource, it will continue to be reported in future SSL_poll()
calls until the condition ceases to be in effect. A caller must mask the given
event type bit in future SSL_poll() calls if it does not wish to receive
repeated notifications and has not caused the underlying readiness condition
(for example, consuming all available data using L<SSL_read_ex(3)> after
B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_R> is reported) to be deasserted.

Some event types do not make sense on a given kind of resource. In this case,
specifying that event type in I<events> is a no-op and will be ignored, and the
given event will never be reported in I<revents>.

Failure of the polling mechanism itself is considered distinct from an exception
condition on a resource which was successfully polled. See B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F>
and L</RETURN VALUES> for details.

In general, an application should always listen for the event types
corresponding to exception conditions if it is listening to the corresponding
non-exception event types (e.g. B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC> and B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER>
for B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_R>), as not doing so is unlikely to be a sound design.

Some event types are non-maskable and may be reported in I<revents> regardless
of whether they were requested in I<events>.

The following event types are supported:

=over 4

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F>

Polling failure. This event is raised when a resource could not be polled. It is
distinct from an exception condition reported on a resource which was
successfully polled and represents a failure of the polling process itself in
relation to a resource. This may mean that SSL_poll() does not support the kind
of resource specified.

Where this event is raised on at least one item in I<items>, SSL_poll() will
return 0 and the ERR stack will contain information pertaining to the first item
in I<items> with B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> set. See L</RETURN VALUES> for more
information.

This event type may be raised even if it was not requested in I<events>;
specifying this event type in I<events> does nothing.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC>

Error at connection level. This event is raised when a connection has failed.
In particular, it is raised when a connection begins terminating.

This event is never raised on objects which are not connections.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_DCD>

Error at connection level (drained). This event is raised when a connection has
finished terminating, and has reached the terminated state. This event will
generally occur after an interval of time passes after the B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC>
event is raised on a connection.

This event is never raised on objects which are not connections.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER>

Error in read direction. For QUIC, this is raised only in the event that a
stream has a read part and that read part has been reset by the peer (for
example, using a B<RESET_STREAM> frame).

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_EW>

Error in write direction. For QUIC, this is raised only in the event that a
stream has a write part and that write part has been reset by the peer using a
B<STOP_SENDING> frame.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_R>

Readable. This event is raised when a QUIC stream SSL object (or a QUIC
connection SSL object with a default stream attached) has application data
waiting to be read using L<SSL_read_ex(3)>, or a FIN event as represented by
B<SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN> waiting to be read.

It is not raised in the event of the receiving part of the QUIC stream being
reset by the peer; see B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER>.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_W>

Writable. This event is raised when a QUIC stream SSL object (or a QUIC
connection SSL object with a default stream attached) could accept more
application data using L<SSL_write_ex(3)>.

This event is never raised by a receive-only stream.

This event is never raised by a stream which has had its send part concluded
normally (as with L<SSL_stream_conclude(3)>) or locally reset (as with
L<SSL_stream_reset(3)>).

This event does not guarantee that a subsequent call to L<SSL_write_ex(3)> will
succeed.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISB>

This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when
one or more incoming bidirectional streams are available to be accepted using
L<SSL_accept_stream(3)>.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISU>

This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when
one or more incoming unidirectional streams are available to be accepted using
L<SSL_accept_stream(3)>.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSB>

This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when
QUIC stream creation flow control currently permits at least one additional
bidirectional stream to be locally created.

=item B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSU>

This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when
QUIC stream creation flow control currently permits at least one additional
unidirectional stream to be locally created.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

SSL_poll() as presently implemented has the following limitations:

=over 4

=item

The implementation of SSL_poll() only supports nonblocking operation and
therefore requires the I<timeout> argument be used to specify a zero timeout.
Calls to SSL_poll() which specify another value, or which pass I<timeout> as
NULL, will fail. This does not allow waiting, but does allow multiple QUIC SSL
objects to be queried for their readiness state in a single call.

Future releases will remove this limitation and support blocking SSL_poll().

=item

Only B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR> structures with type
B<BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SSL>, referencing QUIC connection SSL objects or QUIC
stream SSL objects, are supported.

=back

These limitations will be revised in a future release of OpenSSL.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_poll() returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

Unless the I<items> pointer itself is invalid, SSL_poll() will always initialise
the I<revents> fields of all items in the input array upon returning, even if it
returns failure.

If I<result_count> is non-NULL, it is always written with the number of items in
the array with nonzero I<revents> fields, even if the SSL_poll() call returns
failure.

It is possible for I<result_count> to be written as 0 even if the SSL_poll()
call returns success, namely if no events were output but the polling process
was successful (e.g. in nonblocking usage) or timed out.

It is possible for I<result_count> to be written as a nonzero value if the
SSL_poll() call returns failure, for example due to B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> events,
or because some events were detected and output before encountering a failure
condition while processing a subsequent entry in the I<items> array.

If at least one B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> event is output, SSL_poll() is guaranteed
to return 0 and guaranteed to place at least one ERR on the error stack
describing the first B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> output. Detailed information on any
additional B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> events is not available. SSL_poll() may or may
not return more than one B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> event at once.

"Normal" events representing exceptional I/O conditions which do not
constitute a failure of the SSL_poll() mechanism itself are not considered
errors by SSL_poll() and are instead represented using their own event type; see
L</EVENT TYPES> for details.

The caller can establish the meaning of the SSL_poll() return and output values
as follows:

=over 4

=item

If SSL_poll() returns 1 and I<result_count> is zero, the operation timed out
before any resource was ready.

=item

If SSL_poll() returns 1 and I<result_count> is nonzero, that many events were
output.

=item

If SSL_poll() returns 0 and I<result_count> is zero, the caller has made a basic
usage error; check the ERR stack for details.

=item

If SSL_poll() returns 0 and I<result_count> is nonzero, inspect the I<items>
array for B<SSL_POLL_ITEM> structures with the B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> event type
raised in I<revents>. The entries added to the ERR stack (of which there is
guaranteed to be at least one) reflect the cause of the failure of the first
item in I<items> with B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> raised. Note that there may be events
other than I<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> output for items which come before the first
item with B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F> raised, and additional B<SSL_POLL_EVENT_F>
events may or may not have been output, both of which which will be reflected in
I<result_count>.
