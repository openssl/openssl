=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_check_purpose() checks if certificate I<x> was created with the purpose
represented by I<id>. If I<ca> is nonzero, then certificate I<x> is
checked to determine if it's a possible CA with various levels of certainty
possibly returned. The certificate I<x> must be a complete certificate
otherwise the function returns an error.

Below are the potential ID's that can be checked:

 # define X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT        1
 # define X509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER        2
 # define X509_PURPOSE_NS_SSL_SERVER     3
 # define X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_SIGN        4
 # define X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_ENCRYPT     5
 # define X509_PURPOSE_CRL_SIGN          6
 # define X509_PURPOSE_ANY               7
 # define X509_PURPOSE_OCSP_HELPER       8
 # define X509_PURPOSE_TIMESTAMP_SIGN    9
 # define X509_PURPOSE_CODE_SIGN        10

The checks performed take into account the X.509 extensions
keyUsage, extendedKeyUsage, and basicConstraints.

X509_PURPOSE_get_count() returns the number of currently defined purposes.

X509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id() returns the smallest purpose id not yet used,
which is guaranteed to be unique and larger than B<X509_PURPOSE_MAX>.
The I<libctx> parameter should be used to provide the library context.
It is currently ignored as the purpose mapping table is global.

X509_PURPOSE_get_by_sname() returns the index of
the purpose with the given short name or -1 if not found.

X509_PURPOSE_get_by_id() returns the index of
the purpose with the given id or -1 if not found.

X509_PURPOSE_add() adds or modifies a purpose entry identified by I<sname>.
Unless the id stays the same for an existing entry, I<id> must be fresh,
which can be achieved by using the result of X509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id().
The function also sets in the entry the trust id I<trust>, the given I<flags>,
the purpose (long) name I<name>, the short name I<sname>, the purpose checking
funktion I<ck> of type B<int (*) (const X509_PURPOSE *, const X509 *, int)>,
and its user data I<arg> which may be retrieved via the B<X509_PURPOSE> pointer.

X509_PURPOSE_cleanup() removes all purposes that are not pre-defined.

X509_PURPOSE_get0() returns an B<X509_PURPOSE> pointer or NULL on error.

X509_PURPOSE_get_id() returns the id of the given B<X509_PURPOSE> structure.

X509_PURPOSE_get0_name() returns the (long) name of the given B<X509_PURPOSE>.

X509_PURPOSE_get0_sname() returns the short name of the given B<X509_PURPOSE>.

X509_PURPOSE_get_trust() returns the trust id of the given B<X509_PURPOSE>.

X509_PURPOSE_set() assigns the given I<purpose> id to the location pointed at by
I<p>.
This resets to the any purpose if I<purpose> is B<X509_PURPOSE_DEFAULT_ANY>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_check_purpose() returns the following values.
For non-CA checks

=over 4

=item -1 an error condition has occurred

=item E<32>1 if the certificate was created to perform the purpose represented by I<id>

=item E<32>0 if the certificate was not created to perform the purpose represented by I<id>

=back

For CA checks the below integers could be returned with the following meanings:

=over 4

=item -1 an error condition has occurred

=item E<32>0 not a CA or does not have the purpose represented by I<id>

=item E<32>1 is a CA.

=item E<32>2 Only possible in old versions of openSSL when basicConstraints are absent.
         New versions will not return this value. May be a CA

=item E<32>3 basicConstraints absent but self signed V1.

=item E<32>4 basicConstraints absent but keyUsage present and keyCertSign asserted.

=item E<32>5 legacy Netscape specific CA Flags present

=back

X509_PURPOSE_get_count() returns the number of currently defined purposes.

X509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id() returns the smallest purpose id not yet used.

X509_PURPOSE_get_by_id() returns the index of
the purpose with the given id or -1 if not found.

int X509_PURPOSE_add() returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

X509_PURPOSE_cleanup() does not return anything.

X509_PURPOSE_get0() returns an B<X509_PURPOSE> pointer or NULL on error.

X509_PURPOSE_get_id() returns the id of the given B<X509_PURPOSE> structure.

X509_PURPOSE_get0_name() returns the (long) name of the given B<X509_PURPOSE>.

X509_PURPOSE_get0_sname() returns the short name of the given B<X509_PURPOSE>.

X509_PURPOSE_get_trust() returns the trust id of the given B<X509_PURPOSE>.

X509_PURPOSE_set() returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

=head1 BUGS

The X509_PURPOSE implementation so far is not thread-safe.
There may be race conditions retrieving purpose information while
X509_PURPOSE_add() or X509_PURPOSE_cleanup(void) is being called.

=head1 HISTORY

X509_PURPOSE_get_unused_id() was added in OpensSL 3.5.
