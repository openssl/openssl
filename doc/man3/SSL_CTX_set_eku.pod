SSL_set_eku
- set peer certificate usage requirements to be verified

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_CTX_set_eku(SSL_CTX *ctx, int nid);
 int SSL_set_eku(SSL *ssl, int nid);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_eku() and SSL_CTX_set_eku() sets the Extended Key Usage (EKU)
in the verification parameters of I<ctx> or I<ssl>, respectively, to I<nid>.
This must be an NID corresponding to an EKU OID, for example B<NID_server_auth>,
which may have been obtained by parsing a text string using L<OBJ_txt2nid(3)>.
It determines the acceptable EKU for the peer certificate and its chain,
If provided, it overrides any purpose requirements for untrusted certificates.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_eku() and SSL_CTX_set_eku()
return 1 for success and 0 for failure.
