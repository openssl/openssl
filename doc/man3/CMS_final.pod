=head1 NAME

CMS_final, CMS_final_digest, CMS_dataFinal, CMS_dataFinal_ex
- finalise a CMS_ContentInfo structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

 int CMS_final(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *data, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);
 int CMS_final_digest(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, const unsigned char *md,
                      unsigned int mdlen, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);
 int CMS_dataFinal(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *cmsbio);
 int CMS_dataFinal_ex(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *cmsbio, BIO *data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CMS_final() finalises the structure B<cms>. Its purpose is to perform any
operations necessary on B<cms> (digest computation for example) and set the
appropriate fields. The parameter B<data> contains the content to be
processed. The B<dcont> parameter contains a BIO to write content to after
processing: this is only used with detached data and will usually be set to
NULL.

CMS_final_digest() finalises the structure B<cms> using a pre-computed digest,
rather than computing the digest from the original data.

CMS_dataFinal() finalises the structure B<cms> using the data provided by
the B<cmsbio> BIO for hash-based signing schemes. This BIO can be set up using
CMS_dataInit() and SMIME_ctrl_copy().

CMS_dataFinal_ex() finalises the structure B<cms>. This function must
be used if hash-less signing schemes, such as ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, or EdDSA, are
used since they require access to the raw (non-hashed) data. The raw data must
be provided by the B<data> BIO. Note that this BIO must support the seek()
function so that its data stream can be read multiple times, once for each
signature created by a hash-less signing scheme.

=head1 NOTES

These functions will normally be called when the B<CMS_PARTIAL> flag is used. It
should only be used when streaming is not performed because the streaming
I/O functions perform finalisation operations internally.

To sign a pre-computed digest, L<CMS_sign(3)> or CMS_sign_ex() is called
with the B<data> parameter set to NULL before the CMS structure is finalised
with the digest provided to CMS_final_digest() in binary form.
When signing a pre-computed digest, the security relies on the digest and its
computation from the original message being trusted.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CMS_final(), CMS_final_digest(), CMS_dataFinal(), and
CMS_dataFinal_ex() return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
