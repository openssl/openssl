=head1 NAME

RAND_bytes, RAND_pseudo_bytes - generate random data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

 int RAND_bytes(unsigned char *buf, int num);

Deprecated:

 #if OPENSSL_API_COMPAT < 0x10100000L
 int RAND_pseudo_bytes(unsigned char *buf, int num);
 #endif

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RAND_bytes() puts B<num> cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes
into B<buf>. An error occurs if the PRNG has not been seeded with
enough randomness to ensure an unpredictable byte sequence.

RAND_pseudo_bytes() has been deprecated; use RAND_bytes() instead.

The contents of B<buf> is mixed into the entropy pool before retrieving
the new pseudo-random bytes unless disabled at compile time (see FAQ).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RAND_bytes() returns 1 on success, -1 if not supported by the current
RAND method, or 0 on other failure. The error code can be
obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.

=head HISTORY

RAND_pseudo_bytes() was deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
