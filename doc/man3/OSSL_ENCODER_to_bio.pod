=head1 NAME

OSSL_ENCODER_to_bio,
OSSL_ENCODER_to_fp
- Routines to perform an encoding

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/encoder.h>

 int OSSL_ENCODER_to_bio(OSSL_ENCODER_CTX *ctx, BIO *out);
 int OSSL_ENCODER_to_fp(OSSL_ENCODER_CTX *ctx, FILE *fp);

Feature availability macros:

=over 4

=item OSSL_ENCODER_to_fp() is only available when B<OPENSSL_NO_STDIO>
is undefined.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_ENCODER_to_bio() runs the encoding process for the context I<ctx>, with
the output going to the B<BIO> I<out>.  The application is required to set
up the B<BIO> properly, for example to have it in text or binary mode if
that's appropriate.

=for comment Know your encoder!

OSSL_ENCODER_to_fp() does the same thing as OSSL_ENCODER_to_bio(),
except that the output is going to the B<FILE> I<fp>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_ENCODER_to_bio() and OSSL_ENCODER_to_fp() return 1 on success, or 0 on
failure.
