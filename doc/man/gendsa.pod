=head1 NAME

gendsa - generate a DSA private key from a set of parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<gendsa>
[B<-out filename>]
[B<-des>]
[B<-des3>]
[B<-idea>]
[B<-rand file(s)>]
[B<paramfile>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<gendsa> command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter file
(which will be typically generated by the B<openssl dsaparam> command).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-des|-des3|-idea>

These options encrypt the private key with the DES, triple DES, or the 
IDEA ciphers respectively before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.
If none of these options is specified no encryption is used.

=item B<-rand file(s)>

a file or files containing random data used to seed the random number
generator. Multiple files can be specified separated by a OS-dependent
character.  For MS-Windows, the separator is B<;>.  For OpenVMS, it's
B<,>.  For all others, it's B<:>.

=item B<paramfile>

This option specifies the DSA parameter file to use. The parameters in this
file determine the size of the private key. DSA parameters can be generated
and examined using the B<openssl dsaparam> command.

=head1 NOTES

DSA key generation is little more than random number generation so it is
much quicker that RSA key generation for example.
