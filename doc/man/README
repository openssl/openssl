This is *very* preliminiary documentation for some
of the main commands in the openssl utility. The
information reflects the way the commands may work
when OpenSSL 0.9.5 is released. They are subject
to change though.

The stuff is in POD format and has just been tested
with pod2man where is looks passable. It may well
look odd in html or other formats. Feel free to tidy
up, reformat or convert to a completely different
format if so desired...
